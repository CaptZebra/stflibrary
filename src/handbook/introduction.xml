  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>When STF began its first migration from the Prodigy classic chat network in 1999, the first guide to the Webb was written. Written by veteran member Larry Garfield, <citetitle>"12 Steps to the WeBB"</citetitle> was soon superseded by <citetitle>"The Ensigns Guide to the WeBB"</citetitle>, written by the New Members Council, a now defunct body designed to monitor new members and provide material to assist them in adjusting to our unique environment.</para>
  <para>The Ensigns Guide stood for several years before it was decided to write an Academy counterpart. After several drafts, <citetitle>"The Cadet's Handbook"</citetitle> was born.</para>
  <para>In 2001, it was determined that both books could be combined to streamline and codify practices to reflect relevant updates and provide a more comprehensive, yet user friendly format. With that, the first version of <citetitle>"The Players' Handbook"</citetitle> was born.</para>
  <para>Following the migration from the obsolete, yet revered, effWeBB to the more modern WeBBspace, it was determined that because of the drastic shift in format and style, a new handbook was needed. With this, the second revision of The Players Handbook was born and here we stand even with history.</para>
  <para>Whether you're a new Academy cadet or an old hand looking for immediate placement in a mainstream ship, this guide to our system and our format should answer your questions.</para>
