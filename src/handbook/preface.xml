	<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>A few years ago, someone had the bright idea to create a guide to roleplaying in STF. The result was a piece written by Larry Garfield called <citetitle>12 Steps to the WeBB</citetitle> (WeBB being the name of the software we use). Sometime later, as the club continued its evolution, a New Member Council was formed to assist new members. One of its projects was to revamp the 12 Steps article. <citetitle>The Ensign's Guide to the WeBB</citetitle> was born. The problem was the Ensign's Guide did not take into consideration the needs of players who were assigned to the training ship. Players there were cadets, not ensigns, and their entrance into mainstream roleplaying was different. So Star-fleet Academy created a guide of its own, the <citetitle>Cadet's Handbook</citetitle>.</para>
	<para>When Larry Garfield took over the presidency in November 2001, he asked the Academy to combine the two guides and provide the membership a single learning resource. <citetitle>The Players' Handbook</citetitle> is that resource.</para>
	<para>The Guide is laid out in chapters, each one covering a different aspect of life and roleplaying in STF. Whether you're a cadet or an ensign, you'll find your answers here. Or, at the very least, directions on where you can locate them.</para>
