    <para>Due to the threat of the Flarn, the Federation decided they needed extra protection along the Flarn border, specifically at a planet named Pilton. The Federation Department of Security decided they needed an outpost with sufficient logistics capabilities to support a small fleet of ships, and enough weapons to protect itself and Federation interests in case of an attack. The resulting compromise was the Strategic Outpost, the first and only planned being Outpost 45.</para>
    <para>The station was placed at Pilton for several reasons. First, as an established colony Pilton needed a spaceport to provide a stopping place for commerce and shipping traffic. Second, Starfleet needed a platform for defending the colony and a staging area for a defensive fleet. The station and a small fleet of capital and boarder patrol ships has provided protection for the colony on many occasions and now defends one of the most critical areas along the Federation/Flarn border, Pilton.</para>
    <para>Now with the creation of the Federation/Flarn Neutral Zone, Outpost 45 is once again tasked with monitoring the border, to help with the enforcement of the agreement reached between the Flarn and the Federation.</para>

      <title>Outpost Description</title>
      <para>The outpost is set up in a manner similar to that of the Cardassian built Terok Nor, now known as Deep Space 9. There are 2 docking rings which hang off of the main column and are attached by support pylons to the main column, which is a cylinder that tapers off at each end. At the top there is the Command Level and the Watchtower, and at the bottom, the communication/sensor equipment. The Main command section of the outpost, the Command Level, is located on deck 2 of the main column of the outpost.</para>
      <para>Below the Command Level is the middle section of the main column which contains the outposts work areas, living areas, storage space, and commercial sector. This section also provides access to both the inner and the outer docking ring. These rings are connected to the main column through a series of pylons, which branch off of the main column.</para>
      <para>Surrounding the top half of the main column is the inner and outer docking rings. The inner and out docking rings are connected to the center core by 6 support pylons placed every 60 degrees on the outpost. At each intersection of the rings and pylons, there is a weapons turret located on the top of the intersection.</para>
      <para>The inner docking ring is divided into 6 parts by the pylons coming off of the main column of the station. The inner ring is located between the main column and the outer ring. The 6 sections between each of the Pylons on the inner docking ring are known as the Hangers. The Outposts shuttles, runabouts, and fighters are stored here along with their respective support systems.</para>
      <para>The outer docking ring is also divided into 6 different sections by the pylons holding it to the main column of the outpost. Each section has three airlocks spaced evenly along its length. These air locks face outward towards space for head in docking. This allows up to 18 ships to dock with the station at one time.</para>
      <para>The lower half of the main column contains the station's power core, main computer core, auxiliary computer core, more storage space, and environmental controls. Below the main column extends the stations communication and long range sensor equipment for another 500 meters.</para>
    </section>

      <title>Construction</title>
      <para>The Construction of the station is a standard Duranium/Tritanium double hull transporter welded into place. The hulls around both the Main Ops Deck, and the Auxiliary Ops Deck, along with the power core, and docking pylons and rings have been made denser to make them stronger. The hull was also strengthened around the promenade area of the Outpost as that area as also designed to be a lifeboat in the case of environmental failure onboard the Outpost. This is accompanied by an extremely strong structural integrity field. Most of pre-construction took place in various parts of the federation and final assembly took place on site over Pilton. All in all, the entire project took approximately 3 years from start to finish.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Sensors</title>
      <para>The outpost is equipped with Type-XIII sensor array. The systems high resolution scanning range is 7 light-years, with a range of 23 light-years at low resolution. Most of the sensors are placed at the bottom of the main column with the communication system. There are groups of secondary sensors placed in strategic locations over the rest of the main column, and the outer &amp; inner docking rings giving the station full sensor coverage.</para>
      <para>The Watchtower is also used to help supplement the Outposts sensor array, by linking to all Starfleet ships in the sector, the border protection outposts, as well as sensor relays placed along the border, and using their sensor arrays to get a larger scan of the area.</para>
    </section>
    <section> 
      <title>Science Probes</title>
      <para>The Outpost contains 9 different types of probes, ranging from Class I to Class IX. These probes are kept available for ships needing to resupply, and in limited quantities for the Outposts own use.</para>
      <para>There are approximately 750 casings available for use by the different types of probes. These casings are stored along with the torpedoes in the torpedo magazines for quick supply of docked starships, and supply to the Outposts launchers.</para>
      <para>If for some reason more probes are needed then are currently in supply of the Outpost, the replicators in the Machine Shop are programmed to create the necessary internal components for all of the types of probes that the Outpost keeps in supply.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Computer Core</title>
      <para>The outposts main computer core is set up to run with bio-neural circuitry. Many of the cores processors are also comprised of bio-neural circuitry, though the main storage capability still relies with isolinear chips. This computer core is referred to as the Mark XX+. There is an auxiliary core to supplement the main computer core in case of its failure. The auxiliary core is also a Mark XX+. The cores utilize an active redundancy from the main core to the auxiliary core in case there is a failure in the main core. Through a hard wired connection between the two cores, the main computer core creates a daily backup to the secondary computer core. In case of a catastrophic failure of the main computer core, the hard line connection may be severed to isolate the secondary computer core. There is also a designated computer core for the Watchtower, housed on decks 1 and 2. This core is connected to the other cores, and in the time of an emergency, can be used to take over basic control of the stations systems.</para>
      <para>Due to the security, and the computing power the Watchtower requires, a separate computer core has been placed next to the Watchtower. This core is designated for analysis of data, or any other information that the Watchtower reviews. In the state of a dire emergency, where the Main Computer Core and the Auxiliary Computer Core are damaged, the Watchtowers core can handle bare minimum functions necessary to keep the Outpost running until either the Auxiliary Core, or the Main Core returns to working order, indefinitely.</para>

      <para>The Admiral was wondering if I might take a look at the main drive propulsion units</para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>Along the outer edge of the outer docking ring, and on the dorsal and ventral sides of the docking ring, are a set of 64 RCS based maneuvering thrusters. These thrusters allow the station to remain in a stable synchronous orbit around Pilton. This system also allows the station to hold its position during firing of weapons and launch of ships from the station. They are tied into the computer system to allow automatic operation. But if need be the systems can be operated manually from the both the Main Operations Deck, and the Auxiliary Operations Deck.</para>

      <title>Defensive Shields</title>
      <para>The outpost has a redundant high capacity shield system. The graviton emitters are extended along major sections of the main column. These are further enhanced with graviton emitters on the inner docking ring sections. The outposts shield grid will still operate even if one of the emitter sections is off line. The way it is set up is if one section of the shields is penetrated, gravitons from another section are shunted to the breached area, effectively closing the breach. Depending on the size of the breech, the strength of the shields overall will fluctuate.</para>
      <para>The heart of the shield system lies in a series of 18 graviton generators tied to function in tandem with each other.</para>

      <title>Offensive Systems Overview</title>
      <para>Due to the staggered layout of the weapons systems, any approaching hostile vessel can expect approximately six weapon systems to be tracking it depending on its range from the station. If a ship passes out of the targeting area of one system, the system automatically transfers the lock to a different part of the system.</para>
      <para>The weapon systems are further staggered by range. Ships can first expect to be hit by torpedoes and type X phaser fire. This would be followed by attack from rotating phaser emplacements, and finally mini torpedo launchers. Of course should something survive all of this and happens to board the Outpost, there is always the Self-Destruct System.</para>

        <title>Main Torpedo Storage</title>
        <para>There are six storage areas within the main column of the outpost used to store the outpost torpedoes and mini torpedoes. Each section can store about 1000 Torpedoes and 2000 Mini Torpedoes. While not all of this meant for defense of the outpost, they can all be used toward station defense because of the direct feed conveyer systems used to bring torpedoes from storage to the launchers. Within 20 seconds of Yellow alert, each torpedo launcher and mini torpedo launcher will see the beginning of a close to never ending supply of torpedoes.</para>
        <para>This same conveyor system is used to re-supply torpedoes to ships that come to the outpost for re-supply. It simply extends passed the torpedo room all the way into the inner and outer docking rings.</para>
        <para>The Station torpedo breaks down for both Regular and mini variation torpedoes are as follows.</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>25% Quantum</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>50% Photon</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Of this, only half of these torpedoes are for outpost use, while the rest is designated for ship re-supply use. Of course, this still this leaves about 2250 torpedoes and 6000 mini torpedoes for outpost use.</para>

      <title>Self-Destruct System</title>
      <para>In the extreme case where the Outposts outer defenses have failed, the outposts crew can initiate the Self-Destruct System.</para>
      <para>To initiate the system, the Commanding Officer, or the acting Commanding Officer (aCO), must state their name and rank, their position on the Outpost, their command code, and initiate Outpost Self-Destruct System.</para>
      <para>Next, two members of the senior staff must also state their name and rank, their position on the Outpost, their command code, and initiate Outpost Self-Destruct System.</para>
      <para>Finally, the CO, or the aCO, must state if he has any specific instructions for the Self-Destruct System, and the amount of time until the system initiates. Finally the CO, or aCO, states start countdown.</para>
      <para>Once the System is initiated, it may only be stopped by the authorization of 2 senior staff members.</para>
      <para>The system works in 4 stages. All 4 stages happen almost simultaneously, with only fractions of a second between each stage. In the 1st stage, an EM pulse is sent through the 3 computer cores, erasing any sensitive information that might survive the self-destruct sequence. In the 2nd Stage, the EM pulse runs through all the conduits on the station, blowing out all the circuitry. The 3rd stage consists of setting off charges located throughout the entire Outpost. These charges not only break up the Outpost into smaller pieces, but decompress the entire Outpost. The 4th and final stage is when the torpedoes stored on the Outpost are detonated. At one time it had been considered to detonate the fusion reactors as well. But simulations showed that there would be to much collateral damage done to Pilton if this were to happen. Thus it was decided not to include the detonation of the fusion reactors in main process of the self-destruct. Though a collateral explosion will occur with the containment failure of the reactors, this explosion would not be large enough to endanger the population of Pilton.</para>

The Ops Deck is divided into two levels, with the second level being half a meter above the first level. The first level is at the same level as the rest of the deck.</para>
      <para>At the front of the Operations Deck, and the first level, in the exact middle, is a door leading to the Briefing Room. On each side of the door is a view screen. The view screen on the left of the door (1) is used to show the movements of ships along the Flarn border. The view screen on the right side of the door (2) is used to show communications, and works just like a view screen on a ship. The consoles on the left side of the first level (3, 4), are used by the Strategic Operations Officer, and his staff to access data on the operations deck. There are also two consoles on the right side of the Operations Deck. The console closer to the front of the Operations Deck (5) is used by the science staff to analyze data on the operations deck. The other console on the right side of the operations deck (6), is used by the Docking Control Officer. The chair in the center of the Ops Deck (7), is for the Command Duty Officer, or the Captain when he is on the Operations Deck. The table in front of the command chair (8), is used for any staff wanting to access data. It is also used for briefings done on the Operations Deck.</para>
      <para>There are 5 consoles on the second level of the Operations Deck. The console at the front, and left (9) is the Operations console. The Operations Officer can access the Outposts systems, including communications, sensors, transporters, tractor beams, and the outposts manoeuvring thrusters. The console next to it (10), is the Outposts tactical console. From this console, the officer can access of the Outposts weapons. The console in the middle of the second level (11), is used to access the schematics of the Outpost. It can also be used to monitor the Outposts systems, and movement of personal on the outpost. The console on the back and left side of the second level (12), is used to access, and monitor the stations computer core. If by chance the stations auxiliary core does not activated when needed, this station can be used to activate it. The console next to it (13), is used to monitor the stations Power Core, and fusion generators. This station, if needed, can be used to reactivate the power core if it does not do so automatically.</para>
      <para>There are six other exits, besides the door leading to the briefing room, off of the Main Operations Deck. The doors at the back of both the first and second levels, lead to the hallway behind the Operations Deck. The door located on the left side of Ops leads to the Captains Ready Room. There are two doors on the right side of the Ops Deck. The door closest to the front of Ops leads to a turbolift. That turbolift has only other one stop, the Auxiliary Operations Deck. The second door leads to the escape pods located on Deck 2 of the Outpost.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Brig</title>
      <para>The Brig is located on Deck 12, right off of the Promenade, and unlike most stations, the COS office isn't connected to the Brig. There is always at least one security officer manning the brig at all times, regardless of whether someone is being held there or not.</para>
      <para>There are 10 cells located in the brig. There is also 1 maximum security cell that can be used in the case of dangerous criminal is to be held on the station. The maximum-security cell is a box made out of 10 centimeters of solid duranium. On both sides of all the walls forcefields are in place. Inside the cell there is one bed which is bolted to the floor. Along the back wall, there is a 5 millimeter gap along the floor. This is where the ventilation system connects to the cell. At the entrance, there is an airlock. The airlock is created by two 5 centimeter thick duranium doors. So when a delivery of some sort is made, the prisoner cannot escape. There are also a series of forcefields in place inside of the airlock, which are disabled by the guard on duty when someone needs to gain access. In the case of a power failure, the doors to the airlock are automatically locked into place by a series of bolts, which fit into resting places inside of the walls. This cell however is rarely used, and is usually deactivated.</para>
      <para>The entire brig is surrounded by a dampening field, there are also two automated defense turrets, one located on each side of the door, in case the prisoners manage to escape and overpower the guards on duty at the time.</para>

The Vault is dived into 2 sections, the reception area, and the vault. The reception area is manned by 3 security personal. When someone comes in and wishes to store something in the vault, they are issued a key card.</para>
      <para>To access the vault, two of the security personal on duty must simultaneously swipe their own key cards through scanners located on either side of the vaults entrance.</para>
      <para>The are 5 rows of lockers where people can store there valuables. To access the locker, both the depositors key card, and one of the security personnel's must be passed through the scanner.</para>
      <para>The vault is heavily protected. The walls of the vault are 15 centimeters of Duranium. And there is a forcefield on either side of the wall. The forcefields are tied into a back-up generator located inside of the vault, so if power fails, the forcefields would not immediately go down. There is also an automated defense system located inside of the vault, so if someone enters, without the proper access, they are stunned by gas that is released into the vault. Also as a measure of protection, there is a dampening field in effect within the vault.</para>
      <para>The security vault is also located on deck 12, next to the brig, and off of the promenade.</para>

      <title>Mess Hall / Galley</title>
      <para>For those that do not wish to pay for non replicated foods or cannot afford to, or for someone who just wants to have a place to socialize, there is the Mess Hall on deck 10. The Mess Hall serves a free daily special consisting of whatever materials can be found in the quantities needed to feed most of the station. Normally this meal is made up of food reaching its expiration date, cargo shipments that where never picked up, or other such cases.</para>
      <para>Because of this chaotic nature of how real food supplies are 'found', the mess hall operates on three rules. "First come, first served," "Supplies are limited, and "Seconds are unlikely." These rules, and the limited capabilities to feed most of the station with real food has made Mess Hall lunch a hit or miss objective for most of the station since most of the food 'Magically' seems to loose some amount of flavor the moment its programmed into the replicators.</para>
      <para>The Galley has also been known to prepare special meals at the request of the Commanding Officer.</para>
      <para>There are also replicators located in the Mess Hall, except they are not programmed to dispense alcohol.</para>

    <para>The outpost has 6 hangars in the inner ring that surrounds the main core of the outpost. Each hangar has the capacity to hold 2 runabouts, or 6 shuttlecraft. They also have the capacity to hold the weapons load out needed by the shuttlecrafts and runabouts. The standard complement at this time is 5 runabouts and 9 shuttlecrafts.</para>
    <para>The station also carries 24 worker bees. There are 4 worker bees per hanger.</para>
    <para>The hangers are mostly open floor space for the most part. Lining all of the walls, except the wall located opposite the door leading into the hanger, are racks, where extra torpedoes are stored for use on the shuttles and runabouts if the feed from the magazines is interrupted. On the wall with no torpedo racks are where the 4 worker bees are stored. They are stored in recesses inside of the wall. When they are needed, they are brought out, and are launched. The ceiling of the hanger is one large door. When the craft are launched the doors part, opening the hanger to space. There is a forcefield in place, so that pressure can be maintained when the doors are opened.</para>
    <para>Below the main hanger bays are Maintenance bays. Using hydraulic lifts support ships can be brought down to the Maintenance bay for repairs.</para>
    <para>In the place of the shuttlecrafts, and runabouts, a total of 18 Ranger class bombers, 24 Compsognathus class interceptors, or 24 Cutlass class fighters, can be placed into the hangers.</para>
    <para>The fighters are launched using the same procedure as the shuttles are, flying through the open hanger bay doors. At one time it was considered placing in an emergency launch system that involved the fighters dropping through the floor of the hanger bay.
