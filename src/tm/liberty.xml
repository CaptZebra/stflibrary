		<para>After several years of service, Star Fleet decided that a new runabout was needed to compliment the existing Danube-class.  Step forward Avalon Ship Yards, a busy group of designers who had proved themselves a valuable tool for Starfleet with their previous designs.</para>
		<para>The designers at Avalon realised that they didn't need to make new Danube-class, and so they set about coming up with a design that would be just as reliable and enduring, but suitably different.  After several weeks of nose-to-the-grindstone work they presented Star Fleet with three possible designs.  Star Fleet chose the third of these, dubbed "Liberty" by the designer.  This became the prototype for the Liberty-class runabout.</para>
		<para>As a Runabout, the Liberty-class falls between the roles of shuttlecraft and Star Ship.  The Liberty-class is expected to perform such tasks as</para>

		<para>The designers at Avalon "borrowed" from recent Star Fleet designs when designing the hull of the Liberty-class.  The main hull looks like a scaled down version of the saucer section of the Nova-class, included the "cut-away" section at the front, which on the Liberty-class houses the deflector array.</para>
		<para>The warp nacelles inherited the engine cowling of the Defiant-class warp propulsion system.  They are located on the dorsal surface of the hull, with the cowling covering them on the dorsal surface.  The ventral surface is smooth, aside from the landing gear.</para>
		<para>The interior of the craft is built around a central corridor, which connects to the key areas of the ship.</para>
		<para>Access hatches are mounted to the front (Port and starboard of the deflector array) dorsal, and aft.  Four landing gear, located at 45, 135, 225 and 315 degrees, allow the Liberty-class to land on any surface that will support the weight of the craft.</para>
		<para>The Liberty-class is constructed from tritanium and duranium alloys, with transparent aluminium use for the view ports.  Avalon used Transporter Welding when making Liberty-class vessels, although some Ship Yards do not.</para>

		<para>Two sub-scaled impulse units provide sub-light propulsion and primary power generation for the Liberty-class.  It can reach a speed of 0.24c, which it can accelerate to from 0 in 12 seconds.  Slowing from full impulse to 0 takes 20 seconds.</para>

			<para>The Liberty-class is fitted with 6 type-V beam phaser strips, each consisting of 5 emitters.  These are located forward-dorsal, forward-ventral, aft-dorsal, aft-ventral, port and starboard, to provide maximum protection.  Energy output of these phasers is 0.2 MW</para>

		<para>The "Bridge" of the Liberty-class is located at the front of the craft.  Conn and Ops are at the front, with science to port and engineering to starboard.  Any of these can double as Tactical in combat.  Although intended for 4 people to crew the craft, it is possible for as few as 1 to fly the Liberty-class if needed.</para>
		<para>There is a small, general use science lab found in the port compartment behind the Bridge.</para>

		<para>The Liberty-class is a general purpose Runabout, designed to serve as a compliment to the larger ships of Starfleet.  While it lacks the modular design of the highly successful Danube, it compensates with lower maintenance requirements associated with only having to deal with a single craft.</para>
