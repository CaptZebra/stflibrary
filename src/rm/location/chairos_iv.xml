		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>Chiaros IV is listed as class M for lack of a more appropriate classification. Because of it's natural slow spin on its axis and its rather faster orbit around its star, half of Chiaros IV remains in eternal daylight, while the flipside remains in eternal darkness. This natural phenomenon has created a planet that is only habitable in a zone of the meridian separating the day and night sides. The entire planet is heavily coated in severe ionized storms, which make subspace communications, scanning, and transporters, ineffective from orbit. The only means of communication beyond the planet is through a tethered communication dish that is held in place with the use of thrusters.</para>

		<title>History</title>
		<para>The Geminus Gulf lay just outside the boundaries of both the Federation and Romulan Star Empire, and has yet to come formally into the sphere of influence of either power. The Gulf is three sectors wide. Most of its sparse stellar population was not of the spectral types associated with habitable worlds. Young super giant "O" type stars predominated-the sort of suns whose huge mass blows them apart only a few hundred million years into their life spans-rather than the cooler, more stable variety, such as the "G" type star that sired Earth and its immediate planetary neighbors. Nearly smack in the center of the Gulf's unexplored vastness lay one inhabited world, the fourth planet of the politically nonaligned Chairos system. Under recently negotiated agreements, neither the Federation nor the Romulans could establish a permanent presence in the Gulf until invited to do so by a space-faring civilization native to the Gulf.</para>
