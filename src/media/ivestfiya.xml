    <title>About IveSTFiya</title>
    <para>IveSTFia was born of a bad pun.  In Soviet Russia, there were two main newspapers.  Pravda, or "The Truth", was the official newspaper of the Communist Party.  Isvestiya, or "The News", was the official newspaper of the government.  Both of course were controlled by the same people, leading to the Russian saying "There is in Truth no news, and in News no truth."</para>
    <para>SNN, and WeBBsights in particular, had a reputation for a time as being STF's Pravda, since both Mike Ballway and Larry Garfield were members of the cabinet at the time and more often than not involved in the very news events they were covering.  After the Aye on the WeBB #7 debacle, Colin Wyers decided he couldn't let a good joke go and started a new competitor, IveSTFiya, with the assistance of Owen Townes and former AOTW writer Bob Spurlin.</para>
    <para>IveSTFiya lasted three issues in early 1999.  Sadly it was hosted off-site on xoom.com, and is no longer available.</para>
