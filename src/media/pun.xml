    <title>About Plumbers United Network</title>
    <para>Also known as Aye on the WeBB, take 2, PUN was another of the single-issue publications from the Golden Age of Media.  After the Aye on the WeBB debacle, Hughes dropped out of journalism for a few months but returned shortly after the election of Bob Spurlin with a new paper, deliberately satirizing the "United Paramount Network", the new network from Star Trek's parent company.  It's single issue contained little in the way of news, consisting mostly of random humor and featurettes, although it did include an interview with former STF President Jim Midyette during one of his brief reappearances.</para>
    <para>The Librarian recommends that users highlight the text on the PUN site in order to view it all, as much of it is white-on-white.</para>
