    <title>About this book</title>
    <para>STF has had numerous independent newspapers, newsletters, and other media agencies throughout the years.  Some have been serious, most at least slightly humorous.</para>
    <para>Many of these publications were managed off-server, and as a result some have been lost.  Others were kept on-server, and are still available for the amature historian in search of a laugh.</para>
