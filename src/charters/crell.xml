	<para>An Alternative RPG Area is hereby established in Fleet Four, named Crell.</para>
	<para>Crell is a planet-based RPG, set on the planet Crell, homeworld of the Crag species, a relatively new Federation member. There is a noticeable non-Crag civilian population in the capital city of Crewel, although it is a not-uncommon destination for off duty Starfleet Officers. Starbase 202 is in orbit of Crell.</para>
	<para>Crell is restricted to existing STF members only. New recruits may not be assigned to Crell.</para>
	<para>Crell has no In Character Leader. It is a dedicated Self-RPG area. An administrator appointed by the Fleet Commander will be responsible for managing the MOTD and Roster only. The administrator position will not count towards any CO or XO limits.</para>
