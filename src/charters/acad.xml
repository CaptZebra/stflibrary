    		<term>Gamemaster (GM)</term>
    		<listitem><para>The GM is appointed by the CO, with the advice and consent of the Academy Commandant. The Gamemaster of an Academy ship must be an experienced GM holding the classification of Full Gamemaster. If a Full Gamemaster, or higher, cannot be found, a Junior Gamemaster may be considered.

Should the GM be removed mid-mission, the mission is to be continued by the Command Staff, without interruption, and a replacement Gamemaster is to be found within two weeks.</para></listitem>
    	</varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>An Academy mission lasts for three months; should a mission last for more than four months (120 days), the Gamemaster is to work with the CO and the XO in order to end the mission as soon as possible. Gamemasters are required to submit a mission plan to the Academy Commandant and Vice Commandant prior to the commencement of a mission.</para>
    <variablelist>
    	<varlistentry>
    		<term>Department Heads (DHs)</term>
    		<listitem>
    			<para>Each standard department (Engineering, Medical, Science and Security) has one department head. A DH position may be filled in one of two ways, at the discretion of the CO, notifying the Academy Commandant.</para>

    			</orderedlist>
    			<para>Preference for filling DH positions goes to a Lt (j.g.) graduated Cadet, however an exception may be made if, in the opinion of the CO and the Academy Commandant, the field of graduated Cadets are not strong enough to handle the responsibility of a DH role, and thus training incoming Cadets. In this instance, an experienced Lt DH from a mainstream ship can be used instead.</para>

	<section>
    <title>Joining the Academy Fleet</title>
    <para>New members may request to join an Academy Training Ships when joining STF. The Personnel Department is required to honour department choices, if possible, and allocate them evenly throughout the fleet. Should there be no spaces available in the chosen departments, the new member will be placed on a mainstream ship. The Academy Commandant is to be informed if a member was unable to be placed.</para>
		<para>Current members on mainstream ships may also request to join the Academy. In this case, admission is dependent on the judgment of the member's Commanding Officers and Academy Commandant. They are to assess whether the member is struggling and whether he would benefit from Academy training. If a member does join the Academy in this manner, he must drop all of his mainstream ships. No member can be forced to join the Academy.</para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Departing from the Academy Fleet</title>
		<para>There are four ways a Cadet can leave the Academy Fleet.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Graduation from the Academy</title>
			<para>At the end of each mission, Cadets who have served an appropriate amount of time shall be graded on a pass/fail system by the Academy Staff and presented to the Academy Commandant for final approval. Cadets who pass will be promoted to the rank of Ensign, and positions will be found for them on mainstream ships. Cadets who have exceeded basic promotion/graduation requirements may be asked to stay on board the Academy ships as Lt (j.g.) Department Heads.</para>
			<para>The Academy Commandant, in discussion with a Cadet's CO, may choose to graduate the Cadet prior to the end of the mission. In these cases, the Cadet will be granted all the rights and privileges of a regular end-of-mission graduation.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Failure to graduate and then requesting to depart the Academy, or failure to graduate on the third attempt</title>
			<para>Should a Cadet fail to graduate, he will be asked to remain in the Academy for another mission, on a different ship than his original Academy ship. Should the Cadet agree to remain for additional training he will repeat the graduation process.</para>
			<para>Should the Cadet decide not to remain on the Academy ship, or if he has failed to graduate on the third attempt, he will be found a position on a mainstream ship with the rank of Ensign, with no promotion restriction. It is suggested that he seeks a mentor for further assistance and the CO and XO of the ship will be notified that the Cadet did not graduate from the Academy.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Departure from the Academy prior to graduation</title>
			<para>Cadets that request to leave the Academy prior to graduation are required to wait 120 days before they can be promoted from Ensign. In the event that a Cadet should leave the Academy early, his name will be placed on a list maintained by the Academy stating the exact date that the Cadet is eligible for rank promotion; this includes any Cadets that AWOL. All COs are requested to keep themselves familiar with this list. The Academy Commandant is responsible for contacting the CO of the ship that the Cadet went to when he originally left the Academy, and providing the CO with this information as well.</para>
			<para>In the case of AWOL Cadets, should they return to STF, the Academy Commandant may allow them to re-enter the Academy training program on a case by case basis. There is no guarantee, however, that they will be placed in the same department or on the same ship.</para>
			<para>Serving on any training ship is optional. Cadets who join the Academy program, thinking that it is mandatory, may approach the Academy Commandant and request to be transferred to a mainstream ship, provided they do so immediately upon finding out that the Academy is not mandatory. The Academy Commandant is required to give such requests due consideration. Upon the Academy Commandant's approval, the Cadet may be found a place on a mainstream ship as an Ensign, with all the rights and privileges that a new member, who is placed on a mainstream ship, has.</para>
			<para>Any other reasons for early departure are to be reviewed by the Academy Commandant and Vice Commandant on a case by case basis.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
	 		<title>Removal from the Academy by the Academy Commandant</title>
			<para>The Academy Commandant, in discussion with a Cadet's CO, may remove a Cadet from the Academy program, and find a place for the Cadet on a mainstream ship at the rank of Ensign. The CO and XO of the mainstream ship will be notified of the circumstances surrounding the Cadet's removal. If deemed appropriate by the Academy Commandant, the President may also be informed.</para>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Disputes</title>
		<para>Any dispute involving the Academy shall be moderated by the Academy Commandant. Should any of the involved parties be the Academy Commandant, the dispute shall be moderated by the Vice Commandant. Should the dispute involve the Academy Commandant and Vice Commandant, the dispute shall be moderated by the President.</para>
