			<title>Problem</title>
			<para>Our member count is consitantly declining, as has been shown in the PDept reports and monthly Census. The reasons for this are most likely varied, but it is clear that it is something we need to address and stop if we want to continue supporting the amount of ships we currently have. Given the most recent reaction to the Paladin's decomission, I suspect most people would agree with me on the above.</para>
			<section>
				<title>History</title>
				<para>As you can see in the Command Log, we discussed the prospect of having diplomatic relations with another club, the AQSG, earlier this term. It was generally decided that we weren't ready to jump into a formal agreement with them yet, but that we'd like to try a banner exchange first.</para>
				<para>Well, the banner exchange was tried. Discussions were discussed, and in the end, they're holding up their end of the bargin and being cool people.</para>
				<para>My conclusion is that this trial period is passed with a success.</para>

			<title>Proposal</title>
			<para>The proposal is rather simple, and all the work is done: Formalize our relationship with the AQSG in an alliance. The paperwork is written, the name of the alliance chosen, all we need is a general consensus from the club.</para>
			<para>An Executive Assistant position would be created, titled Star Fleet Diplomat, who would be charged with maintaining this relationship.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Discussion</title>
			<para>There are many things we need to do to address our membership problems, and I believe this is a solid first step in doing so. Primarily, we need to establish ourselves in the internet gaming community by advertising and joining with other reputable groups to promote the activity. This is the first step in doing that. We become founders of something that could become very large and prosperous (in terms of membership), while paying for it with nothing but our support. If at any time we wish to withdraw, we can simply by saying so.</para>
			<para>In terms of a cost/benefit analysis, our cost is the time we invest on the alliance. Thus far, the time investment has been minimal, and I do not forsee that escilating very much if at all. What do we gain? Most obviously, we gain an ally. Two heads are better than one... the AQSG has a unique perspective, but is a group that is very similar to our own. The Alliance would afford them absolutely NO governmental or political rights in our club... infact they don't even get member accounts unless they join like any other member. What we gain is friendship and an opportunity to expand our name in the internet RPG world, and thus hopefully bring in some new members.</para>
			<para>In the future, this could expand to joint projects and ventures, but for now, we're just looking to formalize a friendship. We'd like to move up the next step of testing the waters with this group, and I believe we could only benefit from it.</para>
