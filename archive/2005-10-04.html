The result was a piece written by Larry Garfield called <em class="citetitle">12 Steps to the WeBB</em> (WeBB being the name of the software we use). Sometime later, as the club continued its evolution, a New Member Council was formed to assist new members. One of its projects was to revamp the 12 Steps article. <em class="citetitle">The Ensign's Guide to the WeBB</em> was born. The problem was the Ensign's Guide did not take into consideration the needs of players who were assigned to the training ship. Players there were cadets, not ensigns, and their entrance into mainstream roleplaying was different. So Star-fleet Academy created a guide of its own, the <em class="citetitle">Cadet's Handbook</em>.</p><p>When Larry Garfield took over the presidency in November 2001, he asked the Academy to combine the two guides and provide the membership a single learning resource. <em class="citetitle">The Players' Handbook</em> is that resource.</p><p>The Guide is laid out in chapters, each one covering a different aspect of life and roleplaying in STF. Whether you're a cadet or an ensign, you'll find your answers here. Or, at the very least, directions on where you can locate them.</p></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="start"></a>Chapter&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Getting started</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#abbreviations">Abbreviations/Acronyms</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#loggingin">Logging in</a></span></dt></dl></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="abbreviations"></a>Abbreviations/Acronyms</h2></div></div></div><p>You won't get five feet in the door before you come across the shortened language that is STF. So it's best to become familiar with STF's abbreviations and acronyms:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>STF</em></span> is the short name for our club. It's a lot less of a mouthful than www.star-fleet.com.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>LOA</em></span>	 means Leave of Absence. You take this if you're going to be away from club activities for several days or more.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>AWOL</em></span> is Absent Without Leave. If you quit participating in the club without declaring an LOA, you will be considered AWOL.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>OOC</em></span> means Out of Character. It's used to denote when the player is talking rather than his character.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>IC</em></span> means In Character. This is only needed if you write an aside OOC, and then need to return to roleplaying in the same post.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>WeBB</em></span> is the name of the current STF software. It stands for Web-based bulletin board.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>CO</em></span> stands for Commanding Officer, aka the captain.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>XO</em></span> is short for Executive Officer, aka the first officer.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>DH</em></span> is the Department Head. The standard DHs are <span class="emphasis"><em>CE</em></span>, chief engineer; <span class="emphasis"><em>CMO</em></span>, Chief Medical Officer; <span class="emphasis"><em>CSO</em></span>, Chief Science Officer; and <span class="emphasis"><em>COS</em></span>, Chief of Security. There are other DHs you'll find around the club, which are more commonly called Swing positions. These positions aren't on every ship and typically the department has just the one character. These specialized DHs include: <span class="emphasis"><em>CNS</em></span>, Counselor; <span class="emphasis"><em>CTO</em></span>, Chief Tactical Officer; and <span class="emphasis"><em>CME</em></span>, Chief Medical Engineer.</p><p>What would a DH be without his <span class="emphasis"><em>JO</em></span>? JO stands for Junior Officer, and signifies any character that does not have an all-caps title. Players marked as Eng, Med, Sci, and Sec on the roster are junior officers.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>NE</em></span> stands for Nameless Ensign. This is STF's version of the NPC, or Non-Player Character. For instance, say a ship's CMO is on away team duty and a new med player joins the ship. The person playing the CMO might create an NE to give the new character something to do and someone to interact with, rather than splitting the timeline. The alternative to NE is <span class="emphasis"><em>NC</em></span>. This is the same type of character, but on the training ships. So it's a Nameless Cadet. Despite the Nameless bit, most NEs have names. NEs also have the distinction of being the most abused and disposable characters in STF. They bravely carry the torch first lit by the Red Shirts of Kirk's era: To boldly die so no player character has to.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>FComm</em></span> stands for Fleet Commander who, as the name indicates, is in charge of one of STF's seven fleets.</p><p>Last, but by no means least, is <span class="emphasis"><em>GM</em></span>. This stands for Gamemaster, and indicates the person running your sim.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="loggingin"></a>Logging in</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you join STF, you'll receive a welcome letter from the Personnel Department that specifies your login name and your ship assignment. Armed with that information, go to STF's login page: www.star-fleet.com. This page contains a lot of handy information, including links to various departments. The part you want looks a bit like this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e160"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.1.&nbsp;The STF Login Screen</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="handbook/handbook/images/handbook/loginscreen.png" alt="STF's Login Page"></div></div><p>To get access to STF, you put your member name in the Login ID box. Your password is the one you submitted along with your application. Hopefully you remember what it is. Once you've filled in your ID and password, click LOGIN. Assuming the information is correct, you will find yourself on STF's start page. Congratulations.</p><p>Every time you login, your account gets hit with a time stamp. This function tells the program where to have you start reading. If you last logged in on Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern Time (regardless of your location, the WeBB translates all time to Eastern), the program will start you off with the first message posted after 5 p.m. But what happens if you didn't finish posting and/or reading when you last logged in, and now you want to finish? The easiest way is to tick "Resume Session" on the login box. This tells the program to behave like you never logged out the last time. All messages will be displayed using the previous session's time stamp.</p><p>A caveat: If it's been several hours between sessions, and you use the resume, be prepared to reread a lot of items the next time you login. In an effort to explain: Say you login Monday at 8 p.m., but you didn't finish posting. Tuesday at 8 p.m. you come back and do a resume. The computer doesn't change your time stamp. When you come back Wednesday at 8 p.m., the computer thinks the last time you logged in was Monday at 8 p.m. It will begin the messages at that point. That translates to a lot of rereading.</p><p>There is a way around that, however, and you'll learn how in the next chapter, <a href="#navigation" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Navigation and roleplaying basics">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Navigation and roleplaying basics</i></a>.</p><p></p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="navigation"></a>Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Navigation and roleplaying basics</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#sitenav">Site navigation</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#shipnav">Ship navigation</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#rpstyle">Roleplaying style</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#timelines">Multiple timelines</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#spelling">Spelling and punctuation</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#reportingin">Reporting for duty</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#stardates">Stardate formats</a></span></dt></dl></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sitenav"></a>Site navigation</h2></div></div></div><p>This site is very easy to get around. Everywhere you need to go is accessible by either dropdown menus or links. Once you've logged in, you're on what's called the start or media page. There's some useful, if dated, information near the top, and then blurbs by the various media outlets attached to STF. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and you'll see this:</p><p></p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e195"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.1.&nbsp;Main MOTD Navigation Buttons</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="handbook/handbook/images/handbook/navbuttons.png" alt="The Main MOTD navigation buttons"></div></div><p>The top left button is the list of roleplaying fleets (1-7), the Command Area, and Starfleet Academy. If your ship is in Second Fleet, you select it from the menu, then click the <span class="emphasis"><em>Go to Selected Fleet</em></span> button to the right of the menu. The training ships, USS Challenger and USS Discovery, are located in Starfleet Academy, as is the Academy homepage. The governmental departments are located within Command Area.</p><p>The other buttons are fairly self-explanatory. Use <span class="emphasis"><em>Change your Password</em></span> to do just that. You can use <span class="emphasis"><em>Change User Defaults</em></span> to change how the pages display. However, there aren't many options available. You can also change your email address at this point. The last button, <span class="emphasis"><em>Declare Leave of Absence</em></span>, is explained a little later.</p><p></p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="shipnav"></a>Ship navigation</h2></div></div></div><p>Getting around the ship is an easy task. Once you go to the correct fleet (1 through 7 and Academy), go to the bottom of the fleet MOTD for the menu of ships in that fleet. Then select the one you want. When you arrive, you'll see the ship's page or MOTD (Message of the Day). Don't let the name fool you. These pages aren't updated daily. They don't have to be. The MOTD contains important information about the current sim, ship's status, a link to the Captain's Log, and standing orders. Be sure to read through the MOTD every time you post; you never know when new information will be there.</p><p>Beneath the MOTD is the ship's roster and navigation buttons. The example here is a roster from Fleet Four's USS Alliance. The players' names and email links are not included in the example, because the guest login was used. Other than that, this is what you can expect to see (albeit in varying colors):</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e234"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.2.&nbsp;Ship roster and controls</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="handbook/handbook/images/handbook/roster.png" alt="The standard roster (this example from the USS Alliance)"></div></div><p>As you can see, the roster gives a lot of information about a ship's crew. You can see how many people are on the ship, how big each department is, and what kind of species are present. Looking at the roster can even help you come up with a character. </p><p>Directly beneath the roster is the set of navigation and input menus/buttons. </p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Read New Notes</em></span> section is self-explanatory. You click the button and it takes you to the earliest post according to your time stamp. Above the button you also see a line about <span class="emphasis"><em>Read notes posted 0 hours before last login</em></span>. This is a handy little shortcut.</p><p>Say someone mention ed that you never replied to a post he wrote two days ago. Glitches happen, missed posts occur, so there's no reason to beat yourself up over the incident. But how do you find the post? If it was written two days ago, and you last logged in yesterday, then change that 0 to 24. The WeBB will backtrack to posts written 24 hours before your last login</p><p>A caveat: The WeBB does not take into consideration your current login. If you're reading notes at 5 p.m. Wednesday, and you last read them at 5 p.m. Tuesday, the WeBB will backtrack based on your Tuesday login.</p><p>It's also possible to go forward in time. Say you were reading posts, got interrupted, and you're reading them again using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Resume Session</em></span> option. The WeBB will start you back at the beginning. If you want to skip forward, input a negative number in place of zero. For instance, -24 will jump you forward 24 hours from your last login.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Choose Subject</em></span> menu is used if you're writing a brand new post, rather than replying to an existing one. If you click the arrow, you'll get a menu of the topics available on the Ogawa. If you don't see a topic you need, jump down to the Add topic section. Type in the topic you want created, hit the button, and viola, it's there. Pay attention to how the other topics are written, and use the same style and format. For instance, if you're adding your quarters and you see others listed as Qu: McPickle, set yours up the same way. Be aware that some ship captains have the topics restricted, so only command level officers can add topics. This is typically done when players get crazy with what topics they create. If you can't add the topic you want, send a request to the CO about it.</p><p>Each ship comes with a handy navigational shortcut. If you want to go to another fleet, or to a different ship within your current fleet, you can do so using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Go to Selected Ship</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Go to fleet page</em></span> buttons.</p><p>Finally, you have the <span class="emphasis"><em>Adjust Character Stats</em></span> button. This takes you to an input screen where you can add your character's species and physical attributes.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="rpstyle"></a>Roleplaying style</h2></div></div></div><p>The standard STF posting style is third-person past tense. Unlike IRC or other "live" roleplaying games, nothing in STF happens in the present. For example, a live roleplaying post might read like this:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e293"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;2.1.&nbsp;Live-style posting</b></p><p>Lt. Shozzbott exits the turbolift and goes up to Captain Alf.</p></div><p>In STF, that same action would be written like this:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e300"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;2.2.&nbsp;Novel-style posting</b></p><p>Lt. Shozzbott exited the turbolift. She looked around the bridge and saw the captain leaving his ready room with the XO. She walked up to Captain Alf and waited for him to acknowledge her.</p></div><p>You can see this post was embellished from the "live" version. That's because in STF, detailed posts are encouraged. Don't just write simple one or two-line bits of action. Incorporate your character's feelings, describe his actions, even reveal his thoughts. The more real you make your character, the more descriptive you make your posts, the more fun you'll end up having. Also note that the example didn't include the captain's actions. You never roleplay for another character without permission.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="timelines"></a>Multiple timelines</h2></div></div></div><p>Because no two STF members post on the exact same schedule, you'll often find yourself involved in two or more timelines. This is perfectly acceptable, albeit somewhat confusing, and is a normal part of roleplaying around here.</p><p>Here's an example to better illustrate: You are a security officer recently assigned to the Challenger. One of the first orders of business is to report for your physical. One of your first posts involves doing just that. Then you wait for the CMO to reply. He does, a day later, and your interaction begins. Meanwhile, a prisoner has escaped from the brig and all security officers are called to assist. Unless it's plainly obvious in the plot timeline that the prisoner's escape happens at the same time your character is getting his physical, you can be in two places at once.</p><p>You can continue your interaction with the CMO in one post, and have your security officer reporting to help the COS in the next. As you read more and more posts, you'll have a clearer idea of how this works. The only thing to remember is multiple timelines are okay, so long as you can keep up with them and remember to keep your actions in chronological order. They may not be written in that order, but the actions have to flow properly into the timeline.</p><p>In a possibly vain attempt to make things clearer, let's look at those two timelines mentioned above. On Monday at noon, you began your posts with the CMO in sickbay. On Tuesday evening, he replies. By the time you post again on Wednesday, the brig break has occurred. So you split the timeline. In the sim chronology, the brig break happens an hour after your physical. In writing the brig break scenes, you're working with another cadet. You have your characters meet for the first time during this incident. The other cadet's player also ends up splitting his timelines and is having a physical in sickbay. You have to be sure that your characters do not meet in sickbay, because you've already had your "first meeting" at the brig break, which happens at a later time. This is keeping the chronological flow sorted with multiple timelines. You may write something on Monday that happens after something you write on Tuesday.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="spelling"></a>Spelling and punctuation</h2></div></div></div><p>Like it or not, spelling and punctuation aren't just school subjects. They are important aspects of your post. Do your best with both of these. You don't have to be an English professor, but do try to make your posts easy to read. Several members of STF do not have English as a first language. For the most part players are understanding of this. It's still in everyone's best interest that you do your best. To that end, here are some basic formatting and punctuation guidelines to help you along:</p><p>You don't have to be the Spelling Bee Champion of Mopicqua School District to roleplay. No one's spelling is perfect. But do try and make an effort. If it takes people five minutes to figure out what you mean in your posts, chances are they're going to quit reading them. If no one reads your posts, no one roleplays with you. And roleplaying is not a solitary endeavor. So for the sake of your own enjoyment, work on your spelling. There are online dictionaries that can help a lot. It make take a few moments, but in the long run, it's time well spent.</p><p>Be sure to end your sentences with a period/full stop (.), and questions end with a question mark (?). Shouting is usually denoted by an exclamation point at the end (!), although some people prefer to just write all the shouts in capital letters. Commas are rough on most everyone. Either you put too many or you don't put enough. A general rule of thumb is to insert a comma anywhere there is a pause in the sentence. It's not foolproof by any means, but it gets you close. You can find the pauses by reading your posts aloud.</p><p>Capital letters are your friends! A post with no capital letters simply looks bad. Especially if you opt not to punctuate, as well. imagine if i wrote this handbook without capitilizing letters or using even the most basic punctuation it not only looks messy but it gets confusing its hard to understand exactly what im trying to say</p><p>Be sure to break your post into paragraphs by entering twice after each section. This puts a blank space between paragraphs and makes it easier to read. There's nothing worse on the eyes than a giant block of yellow text. Some players like to write their posts in a text editor (in order to use spell check) and then cut-and-paste them on the boards. That's fine, except the returns don't always translate. So double-check the paragraph spacing if you cut-and-paste.</p><p>Dialogue needs to be enclosed with quotation marks ("), and always comes in a separate paragraph.</p><p>If your character is talking to someone on his comm badge, instead of quote marks, use this symbol: =/\=. That's just an equals sign (=) followed by a forward slash (/), a backward slash (\), and another equals sign. Another option is this: =^=, using the symbol above the 6 on American keyboards for the middle section, rather than the slash marks. The idea, obviously, is to look like the comm badges on Star Trek. Cute, huh? </p><p>Character thoughts are usually surrounded by single quote marks (') or asterisks (*). Asterisks are also typically used when two characters are speaking telepathically to one another. There is no concrete rule on this. You can use whatever symbols float your boat. Just make sure your thoughts are distinguishable from dialogue.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="reportingin"></a>Reporting for duty</h2></div></div></div><p>This can be tricky, especially if you're arriving in the middle of a sim. The best thing to do is report for duty to your department head. Not all DHs have offices on the topic menu. So pick something that makes sense. Engineers tend to be in Engineering. Doctors tend to be in sickbay. Scientists like labs. And security officers tend to be on the bridge or near the brig. Just find one that makes sense and report for duty. Your DH will take it from there. Usually, if the current sim situation makes the arrival of new people impossible, the captain or GM will let you know how to get yourself into the story. Usually it's something as simple as pretending you've been aboard the whole time, but off duty for some reason.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="stardates"></a>Stardate formats</h2></div></div></div><p>STF rearranges the date to look Star Trekish. Take the last two digits of the year, follow it by the two-digit month (adding a zero for the first nine months), then add the two-digit day, separated by a period (.). Again, use a zero for days 1-9.</p><p>For instance, today is April 22, 2002. The stardate is 02042.2. Christmas Day 2000 looked like this: 00122.5; New Year's Day 2002 looked like this: 02010.1; and Valentine's Day 2001 like this: 01021.4.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="ranks"></a>Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Ranks, positions, and roleplaying</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#character">Character ranks</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#member">Member ranks</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#positions">Ship positions</a></span></dt></dl></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="character"></a>Character ranks</h2></div></div></div><p>Starfleet uses traditional Naval ranks. Originally, STF only offered officer ranks. Now, the choice has expanded to include Civilian posts and Cadet placements. As of this writing, a new enlisted rank has been created. Crewmen joined the ranks in Garfield Edict #13.</p><p>Since officers make up the vast majority of STF characters, we'll start with those:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Ensign</em></span> is the lowest officer rank. If you join STF without going the training ship route, you'll start out as an ensign. When creating your character, be sure to consider backstory and age. Nine times out of ten, an ensign is someone fresh from the Academy. For humans, that will make him in his early 20s. Try to avoid playing geniuses or other super characters. One 17-year-old Ensign Wesley Crusher is enough for a century.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Lieutenant Junior Grade</em></span> is the next rank. According to Data in the TNG episode Datalore, a Starfleet officer spends eight to 12 years in the lieutenant ranks. Getting to Ltjg is easier than getting full lieutenant. In STF, it's pretty standard practice to promote ensigns to Ltjg at the end of their first sim. Outstanding roleplaying brings about earlier promotions. Bad roleplaying, a lot of LOAs and/or AWOLs means you could be an ensign for a very long time.</p><p>Next up is <span class="emphasis"><em>Lieutenant</em></span>. Most DHs are ranked full Lieutenant, although that is not a rule. This is another area where realism tends to fall by the wayside. In STF, an active player can go from Ensign to Lieutenant in a year. So your 22-year-old human engineer, who was a recent Academy grad when you started playing him, is now a 22-year-old full lieutenant. If at all possible, adjust his age to better represent the eight to 12 years it's supposed to take to get to that rank.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Lieutenant Commander</em></span> is a threshhold rank. Since the minimum rank for the XO is Lt. Commander, this is where you cross the line into command territory.</p><p>If you're a <span class="emphasis"><em>Commander</em></span>, you could be an XO or even a base CO. Although I have seen a science junior officer of this rank. You'll find some captains in STF are over generous with promotions. They're given out like candy and you end up with some oddball situations, like a command level junior officer. Ideally, the higher the rank, the harder and longer it takes to attain it.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Captain</em></span> is the biggie for most STFers. You are only promoted to captain when you're given the command of your own ship. That rule has been bent a couple of times, but 99% of the time it holds. To be a captain, you have to be selected by a fleet commander and approved by the president.</p><p>The other mentioned ranks are designed for players who want to create unusual characters to roleplay. <span class="emphasis"><em>Civilians</em></span> can be anyone from an ambassadorial aide to a research scientist to a politician to a doctor. You're limited only by your imagination, and the ship's captain. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Cadet</em></span> rank was originally created for the first training ship, but became popular with veteran STFers who wanted a change of pace. If you see a Cadet on one of the main fleet ships, it's not a newbie but an experienced roleplayer. The same thing applies for the new <span class="emphasis"><em>Crewman</em></span> enlisted rank. Although second only to civilians from the bottom of the rank ladder, Crewman will be more for experienced roleplayers seeking new avenues of character work.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="member"></a>Member ranks</h2></div></div></div><p>As you start out in STF, your personal rank in the organization is equal to the highest character rank you hold. If you run just one character and he's an ensign, then you're an Ensign. If you run three characters; one ensign and two lieutenant jgs, then you're a Lieutenant Junior Grade. This works all the way up to Captain. It also works in reverse. Meaning that if you are the captain of the USS Onion, you can start a new character on another ship and be ranked up to and including captain on that ship.</p><p>But member ranks go beyond Captain. As in every organization, some players stand out. They either devote a lot of time to the club, have given a lot of good service, or are friends with the right people. As with promotion to Captain, it takes a presidential edict to be promoted beyond that level. These ranks include <span class="emphasis"><em>Fleet Captain</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Commodore</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Admiral</em></span>.</p><p>To the best of the author's knowledge, no <span class="emphasis"><em>Fleet Captain</em></span> rank exists in the modern military. It's frequently utilized in yachting circles and Starfleet the International Fan Club uses the rank. Also former Enterprise CO Christopher Pike was a Fleet Captain in the TOS episode involving flashbacks to Trek's original pilot, The Cage. Fleet Captain is one rung above Captain on the rank ladder. Although this is a Member Rank, many people also promote their captain characters to the rank.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Commodore</em></span> is a rank typically used in wartime. The original Star Trek used that rank. It was Commodore Decker who flew the shuttle into the planet-eating machine (that the author still think looked like a giant ice cream cone). Commodore is the first of the so-called flag or admiralty ranks. It's possible you'll encounter a Commodore in command of a ship.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Admiral</em></span> is the highest rank in STF and it is purely a member rank. Unlike the real Navy, we don't divide our admiralty into stages. You're just Admiral Whomever. The only exceptions are the club president and vice president, who are granted the ranks of Fleet Admiral and Vice Fleet Admiral, respectively, during their term of office.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="positions"></a>Ship positions</h2></div></div></div><p>There are four main departments on each ship: Engineering, Medical, Science, and Security. These departments are broken into Chief and Assistant positions. The Chief is the department head and the assistants are the junior officers. Although the DH either outranks or is the same rank as his suboridinates, there is the occassional captain who likes to be weird and promotes an assistant above a chief.</p><p>As mentioned before, there are also swing positions which typically consist of just a chief and no assistants. These positions aren't on every ship, and their inclusion depends on both the captain's descretion and the ship's specs. Some ship designs specifically call for a CTO, for instance.</p><p>All chief and swing positions are abbreviated using capitals. For instance CE for Chief Engineer and CSO for Chief Science Officer. Assistants are upper and lower (Eng for engineering and Sci for science).</p><p>Some ships have unique positions. For instance the USS Ogawa is a medical ship, so one of her characters was a Xenobiologist. You'll find a lot of specialized positions on the few starbases and stations in STF. It used to be that the bases had different positions altogether, but that's been changed. A notable exception is COO (Chief Operations Officer), which is the base's version of the CE.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="chainofcommand"></a>Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Chain of command</h2></div></div></div><p>As in any real-life military, it's important to follow the chain of command in STF. This goes for both IC and OOC incidents. The low men on a ship's totem pole are the junior officers (Eng, Med, Sci, Sec, etc.) Next up are the DHs, then XO, and CO. If you're playing a cadet, he's answerable to his DH. Civilians typically work directly under the CO and/or XO.</p><p>What this boils down to is that your engineering ensign isn't going to be giving orders to anyone. The CE can order his engineers around all he wants. And the captain has your very soul in his hands. Of course, this is the enlightened 24th century, so it's not that bad. Ensigns are encouraged to give ideas, and captains don't make it a habit to sell their crews' souls to Satan.</p><p>The chain of command also extends beyond the ship. However, this extension only comes into play in OOC situations. Our roleplaying may be in the enlightened 24th century, but the players still live in the dog-eat-dog 21st century. Flaring egos, misunderstandings, and disagreements are bound to happen. And sometimes, you need help solving a problem.</p><p>Ideally, you should first try to work out the problem yourself. If that doesn't work, go to your CO. If you need to go beyond the CO, your next step is the FComm. Usually, that's as high as you ever need to go. But some problems can be persistent. After the FComm, you can go to either the appropriate cabinet director or directly to the president. For instance, if your problem involves a GM and the FComm can't/won't help, then you would go to the GM Director before the president.</p></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="posting"></a>Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Posting etiquette</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#trim">Trim your notes</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#ooc">OOC commentary</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#reliability">Reliability</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#criticism">Criticism</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>STF is not a solo excursion. It's true that you're probably alone when you're posting, but what you write is shared with everyone else on your ship. What you write, how you write it, and how often you write has a direct impact on those around you. That's why it's imperative that you use common sense and good manners when roleplaying.</p><p>Here are some helpful hints to make you a welcome member of the crew, and not the person everyone avoids:</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="trim"></a>Trim your notes</h2></div></div></div><p>This doesn't mean write short answers. Creative roleplaying, and the longer posts associated with it, are welcomed and encouraged in STF. When players are admonished to trim their notes, it means to remove all the unnecessary bits in the post to which you're replying. This includes the who posted what and when section, as well as anything not directly pertaining to what you're adding. Doing this makes it easier for people to read, since they don't have to scroll down through a slew of repeated text.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ooc"></a>OOC commentary</h2></div></div></div><p>As you know, OOC stands for Out of Character. When you see text prefaced with OOC, it means it's the player speaking, not the character. OOC comes in handy when the player is making a note about when the post occurs (handy when you've got one character in several time lines). Sometimes players will make strictly OOC posts noting something special happening in their lives (a birthday, a wedding), making announcements, or bringing up something of interest. In limited quantities, these type of posts are allowed. Very often around STF, a crew will get so involved in the OOC discussion they'll neglect the roleplaying. That defeats our purpose for being here. So keep your OOC commentary to a minimum.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="reliability"></a>Reliability</h2></div></div></div><p>When you're a part of a team, such as a ship's crew, it's important that your fellow team mates can rely upon you. It's simply rude to keep people waiting for you to post, which is why all ships have an AWOL policy. The activity level required depends on your position on the ship, as well as the ship itself. Some ships have a more relaxed posting requirement, while others require daily attention. Check on your ship's MOTD to see how often you need to post and always abide by that schedule. If you don't, the captain is likely to mark you AWOL and remove you from the roster. Not only have you let down your crew mates, you might possibly have lost your position.</p><p>Sometimes, we simply have to go away. Either we're going on vacation, our computer is going under the knife, or we won't have Internet access for one reason or another. When this happens, you declare an LOA. A Leave of Absence is not only a heads-up to your captain and crew about your pending disappearance, but it is a way to safeguard your place in the crew.</p><p>If you need to declare an LOA, go to the main page of the WeBB (right after you log in). At the bottom of the page, near the fleet selection button is one marked "Declare Leave of Absence." Simply click the button and fill in the requested information. The input screen looks like this:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e473"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;5.1.&nbsp;The LOA screen</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="handbook/handbook/images/handbook/loa.png" alt="The Declare LOA screen"></div></div><p>As a matter of courtesy, write a post on your ship or email your CO noting when you're leaving and when you expect to return.</p><p>If your LOA is going to be more than a month, be sure to talk to your CO. Being gone that long can be a strain on some ships, and a CO may have to find someone to take your place. While most COs are willing to work with their crew members, bear in mind that the well-being of the ship and crew is of the utmost importance. A player on extended LOA cannot be guaranteed his old position upon his return.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="criticism"></a>Criticism</h2></div></div></div><p>There is a fine line between being helpful and being a nag. Before you say anything negative to someone, be sure you're saying it to be helpful and not to be mean. Constructive criticism is the only type tolerated. We're all here to have fun, not be harrassed.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="promotions"></a>Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Getting promoted</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#real">Make your character real</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#proactive">Be proactive</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#creative">Be creative</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#consistent">Be consistant</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>STF is a roleplaying club. Its entire purpose for existance is so people can pretend to be other people. So it stands to reason that the best way to climb the rank ladder is to do your best with your roleplaying.</p><p>If there was a shopping list on what you need to get promoted, it might look something like this:</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="real"></a>Make your character real</h2></div></div></div><p>Just as you are more than the sum of your parts, there's more to your character than just his stats on the roster. Give your character a personality; plague him with flaws (no one, after all, is perfect); and give him a history. Then, use all those things as a guidebook on how your character operates. Was his family slaughtered by Orion pirates? Chances are he wouldn't get along very well with that Orion bartender. Say his Vulcan science professor flunked him, and he ended up graduating a year after his friends. How would he behave with a Vulcan department head? Would he be resentful, or would he over compensate to prove he deserves to be a science officer? These are the types of things to bring into play so your characters come to life.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="proactive"></a>Be proactive</h2></div></div></div><p>Don't just sit around and wait for someone to give you orders. Find interesting ways to keep your character busy and on display. After all, captains promote those they can see. Very often, a sim or plot thread is not going to keep everyone busy. You are going to have idle time. Use that time creatively. Playing a med character? Create a sick NE who needs treatment and roleplay it. Are you a security officer? How about having a couple of NEs get into a fist fight? Or just go to the holodeck and have a little fun. It's up to you. Just do it.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="creative"></a>Be creative</h2></div></div></div><p>You have an imagination. Exercise it. Find interesting ways to address sim points. Make your character unique and memorable. Give old ideas a new twist. STF is only limited by how much you put into it.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="consistent"></a>Be consistant</h2></div></div></div><p>This applies to both the quality and quantity of your posting. Try to establish a posting routine and stick with it. Maintain a level of quality. We all have off days, but it's important you don't write novel-length posts for a week, then suddenly drop to one-liners, only to return to novels after a few days.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="trainingships"></a>Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;The training ships</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#program">The Program</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#who">Who's it for?</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#how">How does it work?</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#graduation">Graduation</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#co">Captain in training</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#rules">Rules</a></span></dt></dl></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="program"></a>The Program</h2></div></div></div><p>The Academy-run training ship program offers new members an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of STF roleplaying within a nurturing environment. Players are taught using an immersion, hands-on technique where they roleplay as a member of the crew from Day One, with encouragement and instruction from the ship's senior staff.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="who"></a>Who's it for?</h2></div></div></div><p>The training program is for new members who want to learn the ropes before participating on a mainstream ship, base, or planet.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="how"></a>How does it work?</h2></div></div></div><p>New members who request the training ship option on their join form are attached to one of the two training ships, provided there is room. To maintain the nurturing atmosphere of the ships, a maximum of three junior officers per department is permitted. Sometimes new members must either accept a position within their second-choice department or wait for an opening on one of the ships.</p><p>Once aboard, the player is a cadet and under the direct supervision of both his DH and the ship's CNS. He begins roleplaying upon arrival, receiving help and encouragement from other members of the senior staff as the sim progresses.</p><p>The chain of command on the training ships is different from other RP arenas within STF. The XO is the defacto captain of the ship. He handles all administrative duties, including reports to the Academy Commandant, AWOLs, complaints, etc. The ship's CNS is the Dean of Students, as it were, and is responsible for the cadets.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="graduation"></a>Graduation</h2></div></div></div><p>Each sim runs for about three months. At the end of each sim, all cadets are evaluated by the senior staff. Cadets who have been on board for over a month and who have demonstrated an understanding of how roleplaying is done in STF graduate from the program and are promoted to Ensign.</p><p>The top cadet in each department, or in the case of equally talented players, the most senior cadet remains aboard the training ship as a DH. All others are transferred to mainstream ships. The Academy Commandant is responsible for finding posts for all training ship graduates.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="co"></a>Captain in training</h2></div></div></div><p>In addition to training new members, the training ships also provide mainstream XOs with a chance to captain a ship. The Academy Commandant selects a sitting XO for the CO position.</p><p>Trainee COs are the captain of the vessel IC, but OOC administrative duties are handled by the permanent training ship XO.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="rules"></a>Rules</h2></div></div></div><p>Because of the on going demand for training positions, cadets are forbidden from roleplaying on any other ship until they graduate. Cadets who join other ships before graduating from the training vessels are expelled from the training program.</p><p>The high demand also requires a judicious handling of AWOLs. Cadets must post once every seven days. Cadets who fail to post within this time frame are contacted by a member of the senior staff and given a chance to return to active duty. If the player fails to return, and offers no explanation for the absence, he is removed from the roster. Except for special cases, no cadet should remain on the roster after 14 days of inactivity.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="government"></a>Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;The government</h2></div></div></div><p>STF is best described as an elected dictatorship. Every eight months, the membership is welcome to participate in a presidential election. After a month of campaigns and primaries, the membership elects the ticket it wants as president/vice president of STF.</p><p>Once in office, the president can do whatever he wants to the club. There is no regulation in place obligating the president to act in a certain manner. Nor is there any official way to remove a president who is failing in his duties. Short of disappearing, there is nothing established that a president can do to guarantee removal from office.</p><p>The first thing a president typically does is name his cabinet. This is made up of directors of various departments and the fleet commander for each of the seven fleets. A Fleet Commander must be a current or previous captain within the fleet he's appointed to run. His primary job is making sure the fleet runs smoothly. He's responsible for selecting captains for the ships within his fleet (which the president appoints), and he's also responsible for coordinating the GMs.</p><p>Currently, the cabinet is made up of seven Fleet Commanders, and the Academy Commandant, Engineering Director, Gamemaster Director, Internet Director, and Personnel Director.</p><p>The Academy Commandant (ACmdt) is in charge of both STF's <a href="http://www.star-fleet.com/acad/" target="_top">Academy Courses</a> and the Academy training ships. A person who passes an Academy course has all his characters within that discipline promoted to Lieutenant j.g.</p><p>The Engineering Director (EDir) is in charge of ship and technology designs used in our roleplaying arena. In order to keep ourselves away from possible copyright infringment issues with Paramount, STF does not use any of the ships or characters in the Star Trek franchise. All ships are designed by STF members. If you're interested in ship design, be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.star-fleet.com/ed/" target="_top">Engineering Department</a>. For discussion on current projects, go to the Engineering ship within the Command Area.</p><p>Once upon a time, the Gamemaster Director (GMDir) was in charge of placing GMs on all the ships of STF. As the club grew, that burden became too much. Now the system is run on the fleet level, with FComms handling GM assignment. Today's GMDir is in charge of the GM Training program, maintaining the IC Database, and providing help and guidance to those who want to run sims. If you're interested in being a GM, the GMDir is the man to see. The GM department is accessible from the Command section of the fleet menu.</p><p>The Internet Director (IDir) heads the <a href="http://www.star-fleet.com/id/" target="_top">Internet Department</a> and is in charge of how the site looks. His job is to keep the pages updated, or see to it those who write them keep them updated. He also handles server administration.</p><p>The Personnel Director (PDir) is responsible for getting new members assigned to ships. He also helps replace lost passwords. In some cases, he also assists players looking to add additional characters to other ships. Typically, however, if you want to either transfer your character to a different ship or add a second character to your repetoire, you email the CO of the ship in which you're interested. The Personnel Department has several resources helpful to old and new members alike. It's accessible within each fleet's dropdown.</p></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="areasofinterest"></a>Chapter&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Areas of interest</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#oocarea">WeBB OOC</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#command">Command Area</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#irc">Internet Relay Chat</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#archives">Archives</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>There is more to STF than government and roleplaying.

It started as a message board section on Prodigy back in around 1991. In the late 90s, with the growing popularity of the World Wide Web, Mike Bourdaa wrote a program (effWebb) that would enable STF to have an Internet presence. He called this Web-based bulletin board system WeBB, and it went online August 1, 1997, with STF's Third Fleet (Fleets One and Two remained on Prodigy until late 1998).</p><p>Every post made on the WeBB from that first day is archived. If you want to check out the evolution of STF, what a ship was like way back when, or find a post you wrote a month ago, head to the <a href="http://www.star-fleet.com/archives/" target="_top">Archives</a>. Here you'll find all posts zipped and categorized by fleet and ship.</p><p>Typically, posts are archived monthly. Of note: Any ship's topics that are empty at the time of archiving are deleted unless their mortality is changed. Toggling topic immortality is at CO's discretion.</p></div></div></div><div class="book" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="charters"></a>Major Legal Documents and Charters</h1></div><div><h3 class="corpauthor">The STF Librarian</h3></div><div><div class="abstract"><p class="title"><b>About this book</b></p><p>STF Executive Departments and role playing areas (ships) are created by Presidential Edict.  These edicts serve as "charters" for a specific department or role playing area, and define that department's rules and code of condult, what authority a given department has, that role playing area's unique attributes (for Alternate Role-Playing Areas), and various other useful and important pieces of information.  Other edicts make clear certain aspects of STF's procedure and functioning in one clearly-defined place.</p><p>It's not always easy to find which Edict applies to which department or RPG area, however.  Since it became common practice to have one giant edict to define everything about a department at once rather than a series of small edicts that sometimes overlap it has become significantly easier to find such information, but it still requires knowing where to look.</p><p>To make such legal referencing easier, the Library staff has put together this reference book, collecting all such information together in one easy-to-find place.  Although effort has been taken to keep these pages as accurate as possible to the original edicts, sometimes minor errors do happen.  Non-legally-binding content, such as the President's "thanks to everyone who worked on this" message, has sometimes also been trimmed for clarity.  If there is any question, the original edict is always the legally binding version.  A link to the original edict is provided with each charter.</p><p>Each charter is listed as authored by the President who posted it and, if applicable, the director of the related department at the time the edict was made.  In many cases many more people were involved in actually developing and writing the edict in question, but for simplicity (and because it is hard to keep track of everyone who made any contribution at all) only the "official" authors are listed.  The original edict often includes an informal thanks to other contributors.</p></div></div></div><hr></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="part"><a href="#govtstructure">I.

All Standard Ships must reside in a single Fleet. All Standard Ships are Starfleet vessels. All Standard Ships are set approximately 376 years after the current modern year, that is, the year 2000 real time corresponds to the year 2376 In Character time, and one year real time corresponds to approximately one year RPG time. A Fleet must contain at least one Standard Ship.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e777"></a>OOC Ships</h3></div></div></div><p>An OOC Ship is a starship, starbase, or other similar division that is present in a Fleet but not staffed by a crew or the site of an actual RPG. OOC Ships are intended for Out of Character interaction between STF members. OOC Ships are established managed at the discretion of the Fleet Commander.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e782"></a>Non-Crewed Ships</h3></div></div></div><p>A Non-Crewed Ship is a Starship or Starbase that is considered a part of a Fleet for RPG purposes but is not actively commissioned nor staffed by RPed characters. NPC ships assigned to a Fleet are available for use by GMs for RPG purposes, and if destroyed are recycled.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e787"></a>Alternative RPG Areas</h3></div></div></div><p>Alternate RPG Areas are those areas where RPGs take place that do not meet one or more of the characteristics for Standard Ships. The President may establish by Edict a charter for an Alternative RPG Area within a given Fleet upon the advice and consent of the Fleet Commander of the Fleet where the Alternate RPG Area will reside. If nothing is specified for a given parameter of the RPG environment, it is assumed to be the same as a Standard RPG Area. For example, if no time frame is specified the Alternate RPG Area is assumed to operate in the same time as Standard RPG Areas.</p><p>Alternate RPG Areas may have a Leader, who is responsible for seeing to the well-being of the Area and will serve as the In Character leader of the Area with a title specified by the chartering Edict. Leader of an Alternate RPG Area may count as an XO position or CO position as specified by the chartering Edict. The Administrator of the Area may be appointed by Presidential Edict or by the Fleet Commander, as specified by the chartering Edict. If not specified, the Administrator is appointed by the President in the same fashion as a CO on a Standard Ship and will count as a CO position. Alternatively, an Alternate RPG Area may have an Administrator appointed by the Fleet Commander who will manage MOTD and personnel matters, but will not have any authority beyond that. Administrator will not count towards any CO or XO limit in place. RPG Ranks in Alternative RPG Areas do not count towards a member's Member Rank unless explicitly specified in the chartering Edict.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e794"></a>Ship Management</h2></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e797"></a>Commissioning of Standard Ships</h3></div></div></div><p>All Standard Ships in a Fleet are commissioned by Presidential Edict, with the prior consent the Fleet Commander.

If the ship class as approved by the Engineering Department includes a list of valid ship names, the name must come from that list.

A ship may be destroyed and automatically replaced with a new vessel of the same name and class with prior consent of the Fleet Commander and CO. Both events may occur simultaneously with the approval of all those listed above. Should a ship be rechristened with the same name as it held previously, either due to a change of class or destruction, it shall incur a one-letter suffix increment.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e812"></a>Commanding Officer (CO)</h3></div></div></div><p>The CO of a RPG Ship serves as the ship's Administrator and In-Character commanding officer. A CO is appointed by Presidential Edict, with the advise and consent of the Fleet Commander. A CO may be removed by Presidential Edict.</p><p>In addition to RPG duties, the CO is responsible for ensuring that the crew stays active; managing personnel and enforcing AWOL policies on the ship; ensuring that new members are given adequate assistance as needed; maintaining the ship's MOTD; optionally maintaining a Ship or Captain's Log; and further duties as conferred upon the desire of the Fleet Commander, or established by Edict. The CO is responsible for ensuring the completion of all his duties, even if they are delegated to the XO.</p><p>The CO has the power to promote members of his crew up to and including the rank of Lieutenant Commander. The CO may promote members of his crew to the rank of Commander with the consent of the Fleet Commander, should the Fleet Commander choose to exercise such authority. Other powers may be specified by Edict or by the Fleet Commander.</p><p>No individual may hold more than one CO position simultaneously.

The XO's primary responsibility is to take over as acting CO (aCO) should the CO declare an LOA. An XO may declare the CO AWOL with the consent of the Fleet Commander and assume the position of acting CO until such time as the President appoints a new CO.

This Fleet shall house all Academy Training Vessels as well as the Academy administrative areas.</p><p>The Academy ships shall be staffed in a different way than standard ships within STF. The staffing of the Academy ships will include, in order of Chain of Command, with the first listed being the highest on the chain:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">XO (Executive Officer)</span></dt><dd><p>The XO is appointed by the President of STF, consulting with the Academy Commandant. The XO outranks the CO, on issues of ship administration. The XO is second in command in an RPG sense only. The XO, regardless of member rank, will always hold a rank of Commander on the training ships.

Academy CNS's must currently, or in the past, have held a DH position in the Academy, or failing that, be a DH on a "mainstream" ship, with positive comments from their Commanding Officer(s).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">GM (Gamemaster)</span></dt><dd><p>The Gamemaster is appointed by the Academy Commandant, subject to the veto of the XO of the ship in question. The Gamemaster of an Academy ship must be an experienced GM preferably holding the classification of Full Gamemaster, however, GM's with a classification of "Junior Gamemaster" may be considered at the Academy Commandants discretion.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">CO (Commanding Officer)</span></dt><dd><p>The CO is appointed by the Academy Commandant, consulting with the President. The CO must be an XO from somewhere in the fleet, for the purposes of assisting to train for a CO spot. The only exception to this rule is if there are no available XO's in the fleet that do not have a CO spot, or if there are no XO's that are willing to take part in the training program. In the case of the above exception, then the Academy Commandant, consulting with the President, may select someone who does not currently hold a XO spot, HOWEVER, this person must currently hold the member rank of Lieutenant Commander to be considered.</p></dd></dl></div><p>If no one can be found who holds the rank of Lieutenant Commander that will participate in the program, then the rank will be decreased to Lieutenant, and so on, until someone willing to participate in the program can be found.</p><p>The "CO in training" will be granted the honorary rank of Captain, but this rank does not extend beyond the Academy, and the "CO in training"'s member rank will also not be extended this privilege.</p><p>Department Head spots (with the exception of Counselor), may be filled in one of two ways, at the discretion of the XO, notifying the Academy Commandant.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A Lieutenant Junior Grade "graduated" Cadet in that department.</p></li><li><p>A Lieutenant- grade experienced officer</p></li></ol></div><p>Preference for filling Department Head positions goes to (option 1) a Lt. (Junior Grade) Graduated Cadet, however an exception may be made if all graduated Cadets were found DH positions on "mainstream" ships, or, if in the opinion of the XO and the Academy Commandant, the field of "graduated" Cadets are not strong enough to handle the responsibility of a DH role, and thus training incoming Cadets. In this instance, an experienced Lieutenant-grade DH from a "mainstream" ship can be used instead (option 2).</p><p>The Commandant is responsible for setting an AWOL/LOA policy in an "Academy Mandate". This policy should be maintained on an Academy page, and linked from the main Academy MOTD and the ship's MOTDs.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e943"></a>Academy service and graduation</h2></div></div></div><p>Cadets who serve on the Academy ships shall hold the member rank of CADET. Additionally, Cadets who serve on the Academy ships are not eligible for rank promotion while they take part in their training. Also, due to the high demand for Academy spots, Cadets on the training vessels, (who have not graduated, or are not in the process of graduating) can only be transferred or offered a position on another ship with the consent of the Academy Commandant.</p><p>Furthermore, any cadet that leaves the academy training ship prematurely has to wait 120 days before they can be promoted to Lieutenant (Junior Grade). In the event that a Cadet should leave the Academy early, their name will be placed on a list maintained by the Academy, and an "Academy Commandant's Mandate" shall be placed in Command, letting CO's know that said Cadet left the Academy early, and stating the exact date that the Cadet is eligible for rank promotion.</p><p>Additionally, the Academy Commandant is responsible for contacting the CO of the ship that the Cadet went to when they originally left the Academy, and providing the CO with this information as well. Additionally, all CO's are requested to keep themselves familiar with this list in some cases, early graduation may be granted, ONLY at the discretion of the Academy Commandant, and based on his/her own judgment. In these cases, the Cadet will be granted all the rights and privileges of a proper graduation, and will not be restricted from promotion as in the case of a cadet leaving the program prematurely.</p><p>Should it be discovered that Command Staffs of mainstream ships are offering positions to Cadets before they graduate, the Academy Commandant has the right to remove that ship from the list of ships that receives Academy graduates either on a temporary or permanent basis, at the Academy Commandant's discretion. This matter will also be taken to the current President, and punishment shall be determined at the discretion of the President, which may include a verbal/written warning, temporary reduction of rank, reduction of rank until next promotion, or removal of command of a vessel (serious repetitive cases).</p><p>At the end of each mission, Cadets shall be graded on a pass/fail system by the Academy Staff and presented to the Academy Commandant for final approval. Cadets who pass will be promoted to the rank of Ensign, and positions will be found for them on "mainstream" ships, cadets who are determined to exceed basic promotion/graduation requirements may be asked to stay on board the academy ships in acting DH capacity for further training and promotion to Lt. (Junior Grade).</p><p>Should a Cadet receive unsatisfactory marks, they will be asked to remain in the Academy for another mission, on a DIFFERENT ship than their original Academy ship. Should the Cadet agree to remain for additional training they will once again be graded on a pass/fail system by the Academy Staff which will be presented to the Academy Commandant for final approval. Should the Cadet pass their second time around, they will be promoted to the rank of Ensign, and a position will be found for them on a "mainstream" ship. Should the cadet decide not to remain on the academy ship they will be placed on a mainstream ship with the rank of Ensign. It is suggested that they seek a mentor for further assistance and the CO and XO of the ship will be notified that they were placed without graduating the academy.</p><p>Should a Cadet receive unsatisfactory marks a second time, they will be asked to remain in the Academy for another mission, on a DIFFERENT ship than the previous ships they have served on. Should the Cadet agree to remain they will once again be graded on the same pass/fail system by the Academy Staff which will be presented to the Academy Commandant for final approval. Should the cadet pass their third time around, they will be promoted to the rank of Ensign, and a position will be found for them on a "mainstream" ship. Should the cadet decide not to remain on the academy ship they will be placed on a mainstream ship with the rank of Ensign. It is suggested that they seek a mentor for further assistance and the CO and XO of the ship will be notified that they were placed without graduating the academy.</p><p>Should a Cadet receive unsatisfactory marks for a third time, they will be placed as a new member on a "mainstream" ship (an Ensign, with all the rights and privileges that come with that rank). Should a CO receive an "Ensign" in this fashion, they are required to receive a letter from the Academy Commandant explaining this, so that the CO may pay special attention to this crew member, in order to help them out in any way possible.</p><p>Serving on any training ship is optional. New members may either join as an Ensign on a regular ship, or serve on the Training ship before going to the mainstream ships as an Ensign. Cadets who join the Academy program, thinking that it is mandatory, may approach the Academy Commandant and request to be placed on a "mainstream" ship, so long as they do so immediately upon finding out that the Academy is NOT mandatory. The Academy Commandant is required to give such requests due consideration. Upon the Academy Commandant's approval, the Cadet may be placed on a "mainstream" ship as an Ensign, with all the rights and privileges that a new member who is placed on a "mainstream" ship has.</p><p>An Academy mission lasts for 3 months (90 days). A mission shall be GMed by one GM, of Junior Gamemaster classification or higher. In the case that a GM shall go AWOL or be removed in mid-mission, the mission shall be continued without interruption by a qualified replacement, which may be the Academy Commandant, XO of the said ship, or CNS of the said ship, regardless of whether the said person holds the classification of Junior Gamemaster. A properly qualified GM should be found to fill the open GM spot within 2 weeks (14 days) of the spot opening.</p><p>Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the XO and GM of the academy ship, concurrently, to notify the Academy Commandant of the date which a new mission starts.</p><p>Whenever a DH spot on a "mainstream" ship opens up, and the CO of that ship has no qualified officer in that department on his ship to fill the hole on his own, the CO is requested, but not required, to contact the Academy Commandant to see if there are any cadets who are ready to graduate to fill said Department Head vacancy.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e970"></a>Disputes</h2></div></div></div><p>Any dispute involving any member of the Academy shall be moderated by the Academy Commandant.

In issues pertaining to daily ship operations (i.e. promotions, demotions, logs, message of the day [MOTD]), the Gamemaster has no authority. A CO may grant a GM access to the ship's MOTD and/or access to add GM-controlled characters at his discretion.</p><p>Under extreme circumstances in which one or more posts are irreconcilable with the actions in one or more other posts; with the laws of STF, reason, or decency; or with previously established RPG events; a Gamemaster may declare the posts in question to be null and void and must include a statement of explanation. Any voided post may be appealed to the Gamemaster Director by the voided member. If the Gamemaster is also the Gamemaster Director, it may be appealed to the Assistant Gamemaster Director. The Gamemaster Director may overturn any appealed post void with written statement of explanation.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Gamemasters may not cause the death of a character on a ship that is controlled by a member of STF. The situations in which a Gamemaster may cause the death of a character on a ship that is not a Non-Player Character shall consist only of the following circumstances:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>AWOL. If the character has been declared AWOL, the Gamemaster may do whatever he likes with it, without restriction.</p></li><li><p>The player gives consent to the Gamemaster, for whatever reason.</p></li><li><p>If the character has taken actions that, in the opinion of the Gamemaster, would result in a 90% or higher probability of death, a "Death Notice" may be served.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p>For the first Death Notice issued against a character, that character will be warned by the Gamemaster publicly against taking such chances, and remind the character that the move would ordinarily have resulted in death, had it been real. In this case, the Gamemaster shall void the posts in question, modify the situation to reverse the extremely risky move, or shall otherwise modify the situation as to allow the character to continue to survive.</p></li><li><p>For the second Death Notice, the results shall be the same as for the first notice, however, there shall also be an email sent by the Gamemaster to the ship's CO, XO, and to the owner of the character, warning that the character has received two death notices, and that a third will result in actual character death.</p></li><li><p>For the third Death Notice, the Gamemaster shall rule the character has died as a result of his actions, and that character will be eliminated from the roster and their position. The CO of the ship shall have discretion as to whether to allow the person to create a new character on the same ship, and what position/rank that new character should hold on the ship.</p></li><li><p>In the event that it is the CO who is receiving Death Notices, the Fleet Commander shall be notified. In the event that the Fleet Commander receives such notices, the President shall be informed.</p></li><li><p>If a character has received no Death Notices in the past six months, but had received them prior to that six month period, all prior Death Notices will be erased from their record, and they shall have a clean slate to start from again.</p></li><li><p>If a member habitually receives Death Notices (more than 5 in a 6 month span), they may be ruled to be a suicidal character player by the Gamemaster Director or by the Fleet Commander of a fleet in which they serve. If a member is so classified, the limit for character death shall be one. Members may appeal a declaration of suicidal-tendency to the President. Such a declaration shall expire six months after the last death notice placed against a character controlled by that player.</p></li><li><p>The Gamemaster may not intentionally place a player into a situation where any action (including lack of action) would result in a death situation. Unlike the real world, there must be at least one morally acceptable way to get out. Violation of subsection g) is the only acceptable grounds for overturning the Gamemaster's ruling of a "death notice".</p></li><li><p>Any Death Notices may be appealed to the Gamemaster Director by the member receiving the Notice.

In the event that the Fleet Commander or CO is one of the Gamemasters in question, the permission of the Gamemaster Director shall be required. In the event that the Fleet Commander is also the Gamemaster Director, the CO is also the Fleet Commander, or the CO is also the Gamemaster Director, the approval of the President shall be required. Special Circumstances missions must be approved on a mission-by-mission basis. Additional requirements for Special Circumstances missions are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A Multi-Ship Mission is one in which one or more Gamemasters runs a mission that explicitly spans multiple ships simultaneously. In addition to the standard requirements of Special Circumstances missions, should there be three or more ships involved the Gamemasters in question must notify the President prior to the start of the mission.</p></li><li><p>A Self-RPG Mission is one in which there is no explicit Gamemaster. Instead, all members of the crew have equal control over the storyline. In order for a ship to be considered for Self-RPG status, the ship's CO must provide viable reasons why his ship is suited for self-RPG status. He must also provide proof that guidelines are in place maintain a pleasant role-playing atmosphere. The petition will be granted with unanimous approval from the Gamemaster Director, appropriate Fleet Commander, and ship's CO. The CO shall be required to report to the Gamemaster Department in place of a normal Gamemaster, but will not have the full authority of a Gamemaster.</p></li><li><p>A CO/GM Mission is one in which the CO of the ship also serves as the Gamemaster of the ship. A CO may serve as Gamemaster of his own ship only with the prior consent of the Gamemaster Director and Fleet Commander. The CO must still be a Gamemaster of Full or higher standing. In the event that the Fleet Commander is also the Gamemaster Director, the CO is also the Fleet Commander, or the CO is also the Gamemaster Director, the approval of the President shall be required.</p></li><li><p>A Multi-Gamemaster Mission is one in which two or more Gamemasters jointly serve on the same ship at the same time. The Gamemaster Director must approve all Multi-Gamemaster Missions prior to their commencement. In the event that the Gamemaster Director is one of the Gamemasters involved or the CO involved, the approval of the President shall be required.</p></li></ul></div><p>If there is a question as to whether or not a mission should be considered Special Circumstances, the Gamemaster Director is empowered to make a determination on a case-by-case basis.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e1290"></a>Disputes</h2></div></div></div><p>Should any member have a dispute with the actions of a Gamemaster, the member is expected to first address the matter to the Gamemaster in question.

If for any reason the Merrimack should change its class, it must be decommissioned.</p><p>The USS Merrimack will be structured the same as a Standard Ship, and be commanded by a CO and XO who are appointed the same way as on a Standard Ship and a GM who is appointed in the same way as on a Standard Ship. However, the Merrimack will be set 293 years from today rather than in the standard STF time frame. That places it shortly after the end of the events depicted in "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country." The Merrimack's time frame must honored with respect to technology that is permissible, known species, species present in Starfleet at the time, etc.</p><p>CO and XO positions on the Merrimack will count fully towards any limits in place. The Merrimack will not accept new members to STF. It is a Second Character Only Ship.</p><p>The Merrimack will officially begin service on or about 1 July. It will be reviewed in 90 days on or about 1 October by the President, Fleet Commander, and CO to determine if the Merrimack has been successful in its mission. The President shall have final ruling in this matter. The Merrimack will be reviewed based on the following criteria:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Has the Ship established an active and healthy Role-Playing environment?</p></li><li><p>Has the Ship established itself as a 23rd century ship, with all the anthropological and technological idiosyncrasies of the era.</p></li></ul></div><p>If the Merrimack is found to be successful in its mission, it will be considered permanent. It may be decommissioned at a later date should it be found to be irreparably in violation of any of the points of its mission. If the Merrimack is found to have failed in its mission, it will be decommissioned. If the Merrimack is found to have failed in its mission before its scheduled review date, it may be decommissioned prior to its review date. Should the Merrimack be decommissioned at any point, all characters and positions pertaining to it will be eliminated. Promotions given on the Merrimack will remain in effect.</p></div></div></div><div class="book" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="faq"></a>STF Frequently Asked Questions</h1></div><div><h3 class="corpauthor">The STF Librarian</h3></div></div><hr></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="chapter"><a href="#d0e1658">1.

They are also known to have decorative facial tattooing. The Acamarians blood is unique, composed of an iron and copper composite. This allowed Dr. Beverley Crusher of the USS Enterprise-D to easily identify a blood sample she discovered on away team mission.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e1945"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>Centuries ago, the Acamarians were a savage and violent race due to the fact that they were split into social and political clans. These clans were the primary cause of many blood feuds and hatred among the race that often lasted for generations. There was one such violent feud between the Lornaks and Tralestas that lasted three centuries which ended when the last Tralesta died. However, there were three survivors of the Tralesta clan that survived the massacred in 2286 by the Lornak clan. These three members hide their identities well and choose one of these remaining members to extract revenge on the Lornak clan. A young girl named Yuta was chosen to be the assassin for clan Tralesta. (See below for more information about Yuta.)</p><p>About one century ago, the Acamarians ended all blood feuds. A group left to become interstellar marauders and called themselves the Gatherers when all the blood feuds were ended. Since then, the Acamarians have enjoyed a century of peace. However, the Gatherers have been the only disruption of peace for the Acamarians. The Gatherers are responsible of many raids in neighboring outposts and sectors around the Acamar system. Captain Picard went to visit the Acamar system on Stardate 43421.9 (in the year 2366) in an effort to stop Gatherer raids with Sovereign Marouk, the head of the Acamarian government at that time.</p><p>Sovereign Marouk brought aboard two aides on to the Enterprise. One of these was a chef and food taster that happens to be Yuta. She appeared to be a woman in her late twenties; however her body had been altered to dramatically reduce her rate of aging so that she could exact revenge against the Lornak clan. Her body was infused with a genetically engineered microvirus that was harmless to all except members of the Lornak clan. But that was not discovered by the Enterprise crew, and this microvirus did not pick up on the Enterprise's transporter filter or scanners. Because she appeared to be in her late twenties, Commander Riker developed a romantic interest in Yuta.</p><p>The Enterprise had set a course for the Hromi Cluster, a stellar group, where it was believed a Gatherer base camp might be located. At the time, it was an uncharted area to the Federation, despite it was near the Acamar system. This cluster is home to many systems and planets, including Gamma Hromi II. Gamma Hromi II is where Captain Picard met Brull, a Gatherer pack leader. Sovereign Marouk and Captain Picard were able to convince Brull to allow Sovereign Marouk and Captain Picard to talk to the leader of the Gatherers, Chorgan. Brull gave the Enterprise the coordinates to the ship where Chorgan was on. Shortly after Brull agreed, an elderly Gather named Volnoth died. Dr. Crusher appeared on the scene to investigate and to see if anything could be done for the elderly Gatherer. Volnoth was a member of the clan Lornak. Dr. Crusher discovered that he died of cardiac arrest. However, Dr. Crusher was unsure of the cause of the death, because his cardiac muscle was still strong based on her tricorder readings. Volnoth's body, along with Brull, Sovereign Marouk and the rest of the away team were brought back up to the Enterprise.</p><p>On the way Chorgan's hideout, Commander Riker visits Yuta in her personal guest quarters, who says that she wants freedom but is already on a set path that she can not stray from. Adding to Yuta's mystery, Riker learns that she serves Marouk not by command, but by choice.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher discovers in sickbay a microvirus in Volnoth's body. The tricorder scan had almost missed the microvirus. She called Commander Riker about the microvirus, describing it as a specific microvirus designed to kill one in one millionth of an Acamarian. Due to Dr. Crusher's searching through the Acamar medical database, she discovered that a Gatherer named Penthor-Mul died of the same microvirus 53 years ago.</p><p>When the Enterprise arrived at the designated coordinates, Chorgan was unwilling to listen or answer any hails. The Enterprise launched a minor attack on Chorgan's ship, just enough to disable the shields. Captain Picard, Sovereign Marouk, Brull, and Yuta then beamed over to Chorgan's ship to discuss an end to all the hostilities of the Gatherers. On the Bridge of the Enterprise, a discovery of a photo in the databanks of the Acamarians allowed Dr. Crusher, Lt. Commander Data and Commander Riker to linked Yuta to the murder of Volnoth and Penthor-Mul. Another quick search by Data found that Chorgan was the remaining member of the clan Lornak. Upon this discovery, Commander Riker had to unfortunately kill her to prevent her from assassinating Chorgan. This was very difficult for Commander Riker; however Yuta did not stop when Riker asked.

Bandi men wear their hair long and often cover it with cloth scarves. Bandi are genetically older than they appear, including the children. This appearance may be a result of the harsh enviroment of Deneb IV where the vegetation is sparse and the surface is swept by fierce winds. The Bandi seem to be quiet, and pleasant people who seem to enjoy meeting with other aliens. The Bandi seem to respect other aliens and other alien cultures. Although Bandi are somewhat placid and stoic in their behavior, their art is quite opposite. Bandi seem to have no desire leave their world and prefer offworlders to visit them instead. The Bandi dress modestly leaving the only skin exposed is their hands and face; their clothing is made of fabric that covers their arms and legs. The clothing seems to be densely woven and richly embroidered, but not brightly colored. A few Bandi wear draped scarves out of the same material of their clothing with fringes that hang down.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2039"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>The Bandi attempted to apply for Federation membership in the early 2360s. They claimed to built an enormous technological space station, completely of modern design. This station was called Farpoint Station and seemed to be made out of tritanium and duraglass. The station's adminstrator and the leader of the Bandi people was Groppler Zorn, who lead the petition for Federation membership. The station was in exact accordance with Starfleet requirements, however it seemed unlikely that the Bandi were able to built such a station. The Bandi claimed that Deneb IV's plentiful resources of geothermal energy enabled them to construct Farpoint Station in record time, however Starfleet was suspicious. The materials that the station was built on were a contrast to the main Bandi city, the Old City. In addition, many of the materials that Farpoint was built on were not available on Deneb IV. The USS Enterprise was sent to investigate and the USS Hood brought several key officers to the USS Enterprise. The Enterprise discovered that Farpoint station was actually an alien lifeform in which the Bandi had captured and forced it to their will. Due to this discovery, the Bandi's petition for membership was rejected.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-benzite"></a>Benzite</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Jason</span> <span class="surname">Lee</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">25 March 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

This apparatus is worn on their chest with an extension reaching up to just in front of the mouth and nose slit. The slit is wider than the mouth with four whisker-like extensions, much like the Terran catfish. Benzites do not have facial hair, and they have blue-gray skin. They have large, short-pointed ears and in addition, they strongly resemble each other. Benzites are very sincere eager people, however, their eagerness is sometimes perceived as superiority. Benzites tend to be perfectionists, and as part of their eager and perfectionist nature, Benzites will offer advice in improving efficiency. This is one of the reasons that Benzites appear to be acting superior. </p><p>Benzites are not members of the Federation, but carry treaty relations and officer exchanges. Benzites can apply for Starfleet Academy, and many Benzites do. Benzites have an extreme pursuit for knowledge and they tend to excel in Science and Engineering. It is also interesting to note that Benzite space service calls for an officer to withhold unusual findings until an extensive analysis can be run and a resolution is offered. Benzites tend to get depressed if they do something which they perceive as a failure. By 2372 the Benzites had made such medical advances that they were no longer required to use the respiration device in Class-M atmospheres.</p><p></p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-breen"></a>Breen</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Mike</span> <span class="surname">Rouse-Deane</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">8 March 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

The Breen homeworld has an average temperature of approximately -53 C, a record low for any inhabited planet. They have evolved with a unique physiology in order to cope with this ultra-cold environment; although they breathe a fairly standard oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere at close to normal pressure, the Breen have no blood or other liquid circulatory system. Instead, their body is permeated by millions of tiny hollow tubules which are open to the skin. These allow oxygen to be carried directly into the body; once there it is absorbed directly through the skin to be used by the internal organs. A similar process carries the waste gasses back out again. The Breen reproductive cycle is also unusual, in that they commonly produce offspring at a very early age.</p><p>Normal Breen body temperature is -38 C; exposure to temperatures above -13 C will kill a Breen within minutes. Given that most known major spacefaring species live on class M planets with an average temperature far above that of Breen, the Breen have had to develop environmental suits of great capability and reliability in order to co-exist with others. Given their nature, it is understandable that the Breen have become one of the Alpha Quadrants leading experts at creating and maintaining extremely cold environments. They are acknowledged experts on cold storage of chemical compounds.</p><p>Given the environmental difficulties, casual visits to Breen worlds by non-Breen are virtually impossible. The Breen strongly discourage visitors, and all those who do visit Breen worlds are confined to purpose-designed encampments. Combined with the fact that the Breen habitually design environmental suits which hide their faces from view, this has given them their air of mystery. This has been further enhanced by the fact that some empathic species, most notably Betazoids, are unable to detect the thoughts or emotions of the Breen. Much of Breen is known to be a frozen wasteland, and it is widely thought that the Breen have deliberately avoided large surface developments for cultural reasons.</p><p>Nevertheless, much has been discovered about the Breen over the years. They have developed organic technology to the point where they routinely use biological spacecraft. Some of these are fitted with cloaking devices, a technology the Breen apparently invented independently of the Romulans and Klingons. They use disruptor type weaponry rather than the phaser technology used by the Federation. They are also the manufacturers of the CRM-114... an extremely powerful portable hand cannon designed to destroy moving targets and surface emplacements. The Breen use disrupters as their primary weapons. They are classified as type 3 and discharge blue pulses.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2207"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>The Breen have something of an aggressive history. They are politically non-aligned, and have been known to attack Federation vessels. The Breen utilize privateers, and one group of them attacked the Bajoran Colony of Free Haven in 2372. The Breen have outposts near the Black Cluster, and have settlements at Portas V near the Demilitarized Zone. A Breen of unknown identity was replaced by a founder at some unknown date, and the "original" was imprisoned in Internment Camp 371. This Breen gave his life by initiating an escape from the camp in 2373, shortly after Cardassia joined the Dominion. In 2366, two Breen warships attacked the Cardassian ship Ravinok then forced it to crash land on Dozaria where they put the crew and passengers on that ship into a forced labor camp on the surface. There, the survivors of the crash mined dilithium under the watchful eye of Breen guards. The Breen may be known for their low integrity and backstabbing nature, as there is a Romulan saying "Never turn your back to a Breen".</p><p>Though normally politically non-aligned, the Breen allied themselves with the Dominion during the later part of the war, in 2375, with the Federation Alliance. The Founders secretly conducted talks with the Breen, promising them nearly the entire Alpha Quadrant, if and when they were to win the war. Among the more notable systems promised to the Breen by the Founders were Romulus and Earth.</p><p>The Breen made their presence felt almost immediately when they joined the war by attacking the heart of the Federation, Earth. The attack was meant to make them feel weak and vulnerable. Very few Breen ships survived the attack on Earth. The Breen also figured greatly in the battle for the Chin'toka System. The Breen unleashed a weapon that had not been known to exist, an energy-dampening weapon, which rendered ships powerless, defenseless, and helpless. The battle was a devastating defeat to the Federation Alliance. The only good news they came away from in this battle was that the Klingon ships were not affected by the Breen weapon. </p><p>The Klingons alone would hold the Dominion forces to their side of the front line until a countermeasure could be found to the Breen weapon. Thanks to the Cardassian rebels fighting to free their world from the Dominion, a Dominion ship with the Breen weapon newly installed was stolen and returned to the Federation for study. A countermeasure was later developed for the Breen energy-dampening weapon.</p><p>A large Federation-Klingon-Romulan fleet entered Cardassian space looking to end the war. During the battle, a turning point was reached when the Cardassians switch sides and began firing on the Jem'Hadar and Breen ships. The Dominion retreated to Cardassia. With their new Cardassian allies, the Federation Alliance pushed onward to Cardassia Prime. After linking with fellow changeling Odo (convincing her to stop the bloodshed), the female Founder agreed to surrender, and the war was over.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-bynars"></a>Bynars</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Mike</span> <span class="surname">Rouse-Deane</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">5 February 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

Unlike the Borg, the Bynars are a benign species, and many have served on Federation Starbases as computer experts. The Bynars are heavily dependant on computers, to the extent that their thought processes are as close to binary as is possible for an organic being. Indeed, they are unable to live without the central computer system on their world which interlinks them all. The Bynars, who always come in groups of two, as to communication to each other. There are similarities with the Bynars and the Borg, as in they are linked via a central computer, but they always need another one present with them, to function. Each Bynar has a device implanted into their brain, as to transfer digitally information from one Bynar to another.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2297"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>The Bynar sun, Beta Magellan, went nova in 2364, which led to the Enterprise-D's intervention in the matter. During the Enterprise's upgrading on Starbase 74, the Bynars engineered a problem within the ships antimatter containment, in which the ship was set on autopilot and directed away from the station, whereupon the Bynars took control and headed towards their homeworld, in which they had predicted that their sun would go nova. For the Bynar's survival, they would have to shut down their computer system to ensure its survival. Desperate to preserve their species from extinction, the Bynars needed a large computer system which would back up their original one. They decided that the ideal choice would be the computer core of a Galaxy class starship, the most powerful in existance at the time. Unfortunately, the Bynars believed that the Federation would refuse to help, and therefore hijacked the Enterprise-D. During this, the Bynars had arranged for two senior officers, Commander Riker and Captain Picard, to be distracted on the holodeck during the entire affair, so on arrival of their system, the officers could reactivate the Bynars computer system and revive the species.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-caitian"></a>Caitian</h2></div><div><h3 class="subtitle"><i>Caitus Sapien</i></h3></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Randy</span> <span class="surname">McCullick</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">30 November 2003</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

They possess sleek bodies covered in soft fur, which is of a golden coloration, similar to Terran lions. Caitians are extremely agile, dexterous and fast. They are bipedal, with a thick mane (darker color than the rest of the fur, but it can range in color), long tail, and large golden eyes that provide excellent low-light vision. On extremely rare occasions, a Caitian is born with completely black fur and mane. There has never been a discovered pattern to this, as it does not follow familial lines. It is considered very attractive and exotic by other Caitians. Ancient Caitian legends also tell of a White Caitian, but no such Caitian has been born in recorded history. The Caitian excellence in hearing makes them ideal experts in Communications. They hear ranges far above and below normal human ranges.</p><p>Caitians are Carnivorous hunters, by nature. They prefer their meat raw (blood temperature) or rare, and find it difficult to digest vegetables, although grains are easier. Over 90% of Caitians suffer from Heart Disease. This usually results in strokes and heart failure at around age 70. Almost all Caitians above that age require artificial hearts. As a result, the hospitals on Cait are the best at such surgeries, as they are so common.</p><p>Shedding season for all Caitians occurs once every six months. The season where a Caitian Female is fertile occurs once every six months as well, at opposite parts of the year. Caitians usually do not actively choose a mate, but instead they go through a process called bonding, which is as much physical as psychological. After adolescence, Caitians give off a pheromone that tells others that they are unbonded and are therefore available. When two Caitians bond, their pheromones shift and are now read as ?unavailable? by other Caitains. The two Caitians become addicted to each other?s pheromones, and as a result feel the need to be close to one another. The entire process occurs on a subconscious level and can happen without either Caitian knowing it at the time. With rare exceptions, these Caitians fall in love and are married. As a result, Caitian society sees bonding as a form of engagement. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to bonding, though in most occasions it occurs when couples first meet. The intensity of the bond varies per individual. The bond lasts for the rest of the Caitians life, and is only broken upon the death of one of the Caitians. Breaking a bond is extremely traumatic for a Caitian. Only in instances where a bond is broken shortly after it is form is future rebonding to another person possible, and even then it is extremely rare. The first known instance of a Caitian bonding with a non-Caitian occurred in 2278 and more have happened since that time. A Caitian can mate without being bonded, but such activitity is considered "shallow" and "unfulfilling" compared to bond-mates.</p><p>Standard adult Caitians wear a day-robe, a one piece outfit designed for coolness of wear, as Cait is 90% hot Savannah. Children can wear day-robes, but it is not uncommon for them not to wear clothing until adolescence. Caitians wear a collar at all times in public, as the neck is considered a vulnerable/sensitive area. Bonded Caitians following old traditions may wear identical ankle bracelets, to show their devotion to each other. According to the tradition, this anklet is never supposed to be removed for the rest of their lives. Shoes or boots are typically not worn by Caitians, even in Starfleet.</p><p>The Caitian language consists of multiple soft tones, spoken with a deep purring resonance; this style of communication makes it difficult for the Caitians to adapt to phoenetic languages. When a Caitian speaks Standard as a second language, it is usually punctuated by purring "R"s and hissing "S"s. Caitian female names typically start with M', while male names typically start with S'.</p><p>While it has rapidly been dwindling the last few centuries, a few Caitians still religiously worship their matron Deity, the Goddess, a monotheistic entity, that according to their religion created the universe. Opposing her are the Dark Ones, who try to trick Caitians and make their lives miserable. The Goddess is worshipped in Detailed statues, usually kept in a personal shine in the home.</p><p>Another strong part of Caitian belief is their claws. While a Caitian may dull their claws to keep from damaging things during casual contact, a Caitian will never of their own free will deliberately trim their claws to the point of uselessness or have them permanently removed. Many Caitians would rather die then endure such humiliation, and to do such to a Caitian against their will is tantamount to rape.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2393"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>Cait?s origins are steeped in mystery. The Kzin, the Regulans, and the Lyrans all claim that Cait was essentially a "Lost Colony" of theirs. Considering the similar genetic markup of the four species, those theories are possible. However, it is also possible that all four species were ?seeded? in that section of space by an alien race akin to the Preservers. However it was formed, Caitian culture evolved separately from the other races.</p><p>Initially, Caitians were a hunting people, wild predators on the savannah. However, what farming did to the humans, ranching did to the Caitians. The domestication of local wildlife turned the nomadic people into more sedentary people. As a result, culture soon flourished and in a few thousand years, civilization, based around the ranch principle.</p><p>Cait would have remained a small, insignifigant planet had not it?s system been rich in a rare element: Dilithium. This brought it to the attention of the local powers, including the Federation. Cait was admitted to the Federation in 2234 and has been a great asset since.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-chameloid"></a>Chameloid</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Elana</span> <span class="surname">Rubin</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">2 November 2001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

A Chameloid's physique is unlike that of a Changelings in that a Chameloid is a "solid", with muscles and a skeleton. The skeleton is made of a very strong and flexible cartilage that acts a little like elastic but with no diminishing of its overall strength when "streched". A Chameloid have more then twice the amount of muscles that a Human has. Chameloids have an amazing knowledge of of their race's physique, as well as physiques of other races, and without this knowlenge when a Chameloid changes into another species the change would only be superficial. With the knowledge of the physiques of other species, the Chameloid can arrange its muscles to take advantage of that species strengths.</p><p>Chameloids can improve minor muscular structures but cannot preform gross changes to the form of the species the Chameloid has adopted. For example a Chameloid can improve a humans eyes so that they can see better and farther or see better in the dark. However when they adopt that form a Chameloid cannot change the eyes so they can see through things on a X-ray band wave. One very curious thing about Chameloid biology is that their genes are dominant no matter what. For example if a Chameloid was to have a child with someone of a different species, the child would have the shape-shifting ability with no diminishing of this trait.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2481"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>Chameloids were long thought to be a myth until Captain Kirk met one in a Klingon prison in 2293. In the past Chameloids have worked as spys and other sinister ocupations. It is unknown if Chameloids have served in Starfleet as they are extrememly rare individuals.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-cytherian"></a>Cytherian</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Jason</span> <span class="surname">Lee</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">19 April 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

However, they are not ordinary explorers. The Cytherians prefer to stay home and send out probes of advanced technology. These highly advanced probes can reprogram computers and even living beings. In addition, these probes use a propulsion method unknown to Starfleet that does not create any subspace distortions or field emissions. The purpose of these probes are to give information in order to bring other races to them. In this way, the Cytherians explore the galaxy by bringing the galaxy to them. The Cytherian that appeared on the USS Enterprise only showed his head. It appears that it was some type of holographic image or some type of technology beyond the Federation's understanding. This particular Cytherian looked human like, and was very elderly. By the looks of the Cytherians, they appear to have a blue patch in the middle of their foreheads as well as ridges similar to Klingon foreheads. The difference between this particular Cytherian forehead and a Klingon's forehead was that It was wider, flat, and curved in opposite direction from the bottom to the top, which allowed a flat area where the blue patch would be. This Cytherian also had a large flat nose; the ridges on the forehead seems to start where the top of the nose becomes part of the forehead. This Cytherian had white hair and seem to wear his hair with thick strands of hair running down past his face. These strands of hair only extended 1 to 2 inches past the face. Lastly, this Cytherian also had a white beard.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2563"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>On Stardate 44704.2, the USS Enterprise-D went to investigate a problem with the Argus Array, on the edge of Federation space. The USS Enterprise-D found an alien probe near the array. When the Enterprise sent out a shuttle, the probe attempted to reprogram the shuttle but failed. However, the probe managed to reprogram Lt. Barclay instead. It was discovered that the probe was unable to reprogram the Argus Array or the shuttlecraft's computers, but it managed to reprogram Lt. Barclay. The probe was able to increase Lt. Barclay's intelligence, creativity and everything else in his brain. In order to save the Argus Array, Lt. Barclay had to connect to the computer using a neural interface on Holodeck 3. Apparently, the probe caused something to change Lt. Barclay where his intelligence would increase bit by bit. So when Lt. Barclay connected to the computer of the USS Enteprise-D, he became the computer. Since his higher level brain functions were in the computer, he was not able to return to his body and unable to disconnect from the computer. When Lt. Barclay connected to the computer of the USS Enterprise-D, he was able to use the graviton emissions from the USS Enterprise's warp nacelles to create a large subspace distortion. This subspace distortion allowed the USS Enterprise to travel to the Cytherians for first contact. The Cytherians did not pose no threat and only wanted an information exchange. Only one Cytherian appeared on the Bridge of the USS Enterprise-D. He did not physically appeared, but only the image of his head was shown. They seem to be peaceful and did not mean any harm. They were able to return Lt. Barclay to normal, however it seems Lt. Barclay has retained some of the intelligence and confidence that he picked up from this experiance. Lt. Barclay, once he was normal again, was able to explain to Captain Picard about the Cytherians. The information exchanged from the Cytherians will take decades for Federation sciencists to analyse. The USS Enterprise-D had spent 10 days in the company of the Cytherians before returning to Federation space.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-dilkian"></a>Dilkian</h2></div><div><h3 class="subtitle"><i>Homo Dilko</i></h3></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Samuel</span> <span class="surname">Moritz</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">6 November 2001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

The whole planet is run by a Council that consists of the 10 oldest Dilkians alive. Everything is decided by voting, and whatever the Council orders happens. The Dilkians are almost identical to humans in appearance except for two things. One, they have two small and perfectly round bumps in the centre of their forheads, and two, they mature much faster than a human. For example, A 10 year-old Dilkian has the size and brainpower of a 20 year-old human. The downside to this is that the Dilkians have a much shorter lifespan than humans.</p><p>The Dilkians are also a very peaceful race. In fact so peaceful that their spaceships have no physical weapons whatsoever. But they defend themselves in other ways. When confronted with an enemy in space they first try to be as diplomatic as possible, but if that fails they use their psychic weapon. Everyone aboard the ship gather their energy and sends small psychic blasts to the enemy ship. Every blast makes enemy crew more and more sleepy. After a short while they are asleep. The Dilkians use the time that passes until the awakening to get away at maximum warp.</p><p>Their planet has a sensor disruption system that were built by Dilkian ancestors many centuries ago, that hides the techology on the planet from normal sensors. Every Dilkian is born with the weapon and is trained from a young age to use it. Should anyone misuse it they are immediatly brought to the Council which in an advanced and ancient ceremony creates a mental barrier in the mind of the target person. The barrier prevents them from using any psychic powers. Many of the rejects have tried to remove that barrier, but they have never been successful. After losing their weapon they often leave the planet in shame, towards another M class planet in the system, where the rejected Dilkians have founded a colony, that wants no contact with the Federation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2645"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>Their planet has a sensor disruption system that were built by Dilkian ancestors many centuries ago, that hides the techology on the planet from normal sensors.

The federation and the Dilkians of Dilkia Prime live in peace, and Dilkia Prime with it's tropical climate is a popular tourist resort for many people. </p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-eldaraane"></a>Eldaraane</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Jason</span> <span class="surname">Lee</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">13 March 2003</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

The Eldaraane have ears like Vulcans, however, much more pointy and would be described as more 'elf'/eleven' like. The Eldaraane have a rich culture and are a warp capable species. The Eldaraane are also very spiritual and believe that everything needs to be in spiritual and natural alignment. They are very intelligent group of beings who are remarkable problem solvers. The technology that the Eldaraane have is beyond the understanding of current 24th century scientists. Since the Eldaraane have remarkable length of lives, their early scientists were able to make incredible advancements. They have not encountered the Dominion or the Federation in their nomadic wanderings.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2723"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>Ten thousand years ago, the Eldaraane's star, Tala, was on the verge of explosion. [In terms to Earth years, 8000 B.C.] It was guessed that the star would explode within two thousand years. Many Eldaraane did not wish to leave their home world, so they were deciding for the worse. An Eldaraane scientist by the name of Jor Salous theorized if a special warp bubble surrounded the planet, it might be possible to move the planet out of harm's way. The idea was to build a metal sphere around the planet with enough density and weight that it a gravitational force balance acted between the sphere around the planet and the planet itself. Additionally, the sphere would contain many artificial generators, such as gravity and light generators, to produce the necessary effects from its single moon and sun. The idea is not necessarily impossible with the technology that the Eldaraane possessed, but it seemed too absurd. Many of the scientists of the Eldaraane were trying to figure out how to chemically balance Tala to prevent its explosion.</p><p>The proposal was laughed at by many scientists, but for the sake of argument, they permitted Jor Salous to built an experimental "planet mover" on their moon, Dara. Jor received a large grant from the planetary government to build his planet mover on Dara. It took a fourth of Jor?s lifetime building what he needed for Dara. But after considerable research, planning and construction, Jor completed his project, and it was successful. Toward the end of his project, many Eldaraane began to believe into Jor Salous and worked closely to understand how his project worked. Jor Salous made it possible to move Dara out of orbit and into low warp speeds. Jor?s popularity soared on Talatinwe, gathering many students and scientists to understand his theories so that they might be able to continue Jor?s work after he passed away. However, it took much difficulty to move the small moon back into place.</p><p>Construction on Talatinwe moving sphere started on what the Eldaraane began to call, 1900 B.T.E., otherwise known as Before Tala Explodes. The scientific community on Talatinwe had a split focus between on correcting the star and performing Jor?s planetary moving project. Jor Salous died in 1597 BTE, at a ripe age of 412. Eldaraane scientists completed Jor?s Talatinwe project in 123 BTE. They had made many improvements, but were not able to move the planet. Those who began to fear for the worse started construction of homes and communities on Dala the year after the Talatinwe project were completed. In 100 BTE, a major shield project on Talatinwe and on Dala began construction. A small group of scientists had been working on creating powerful shielding that might shield Talatinwe and Dala from the explosion of Tala, or at least to weaken its effects since Jor?s project on Dala. In 54 BTE, the pressure was on. All attempts in stopping Tala from exploding had failed, and problems were still in the planetary movement project of Talatinwe. Many Eldaraane feared for the worse, and half of the population on Talatinwe moved to Dala. In 34 BTE, the shield project completed and it was thought that if the Jor project failed on Talatinwe, the Jor sphere along with the shields would at least protect Talatinwe from major problems. In 15 BTE, a brilliant scientist named Palan Shaldar found an error in Jor?s calculations for Talatinwe. This error was the problem in the Talatinwe project and Palan calculated that the correction would be able to be corrected in 7 years. In 8 BTE, the Jor-Talatinwe project officially completed, which allowed Talatinwe to move out of the star system. By 1 BTE, Talatinwe had reached the outer edges of the star system after careful and skillful navigation. When 0 BTE occurred, Tala exploded, and Talatinwe along with its single moon, Dala, and the Eldaraane were safely out of their planetary system.</p><p>Since then, the Eldaraane have numbered their years as an age of wandering, where they started their journey counted as 1 AW. They were hoping to search for a place where Talatinwe and Dala might fit into an uninhabited star system with only a few planets that matched something similar to their star. To the Eldaraane, placing their planet and moon 'any old place' was unacceptable. The Eldaraane wanted a place where they can place their planet for a long time without fear or worry of their new star exploding and that their new star had an exact harmonic nature to their previous star. Essentially, they would only settle their planet in a star system that did not have any other alien culture and fit accordingly to their belief that their planet and moon belonged to that star system.</p><p>As the Eldaraane move their planet and moon, at certain periods will some Eldaraane will move to settle other worlds or move with other alien cultures. Some of these 'offshoots' forget they were Eldaraane, and few of them carry their legend of the Eldaraane. Scouts and supply ships of the Eldaraane have very tight schedules to make their rendezvous with the planet or moon. If any supply ship does not make it in time, they are considered lost and will never see their home planet again. These lost Eldaraane become a part of a group of wanderers from other lost Eldaraane or they settle down in other alien cultures.</p><p>Their star system was located in the deep "Western" edges of the Alpha Quadrant, in the outer rim of the galaxy. Through their course of their travels the Eldaraane have made numerous improvements to their shield design, warp speed and to their artificial ecosystem. Additionally, the Eldaraane have built upon the outside of the domes of the planet and the moon to provide more support in shielding, power and warp capacity. Other improvements have included cloaking technology, but are used limited only for emergencies due to the power drain on their systems. It is now rumored that both planet-moving ships travel at a constant speed of warp 6. The last known location of the Eldaraane is said that the Eldaraane are moving generally speaking "east" toward Federation space.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-etopian"></a>Etopian</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Amanda</span> <span class="surname">Noon</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">7 December 2001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

They have ten months and split down into ten day weeks, with five weeks in each month. Leadership is passed down in families unless a family is shamed then the next highest family takes over the leadership. Every ten earth years the Tribal leaders of each nation pick one amongst them to be the nation leader. These Nation leaders then pick the World Leader.</p><p>The Economy is based on the free market but all members of society are expected to pay a tithe of all earnings to their tribal leader. If a nation decides that more money is needed then the tribal leaders are ordered to collect extra tithes. For example the colonisation projects were paid for with extra tithes from all the nations. The nations were then entitled to put forward their share of colonists for the program. When the moons were turned into the industrial centres for Etopos each nation was given responsibility for a share of the development. In return each nation receives a share of the income.</p><p>When the colonies were formed on Mustine and Trexite a similar arrangement was set up. All the nations supported the colonies for the first one hundred earth years. After this the colonies were declared independent and left to their own devices. Most Etopians live a simple life, farming and gardening are common forms of employment. Many are skilled in agro sciences, others specialise in terraforming. Those without greenfingers tend to find their way to the moons.</p><p>Etopos exports many foodstuffs, famous for the Etopian Mallow fruits, highly prized as they are not only delicious but very difficult to transport without ruining their delicate flavour and texture. All Etopians are guaranteed to receive an education, medical care, shelter and food. In return they pay their tithes. Although the standard that must be provided by the Tribal leader is not stipulated, therefore it is generally in people's better interests to work to provide better for themselves and their families. The World Government tries to ensure that certain basic levels of education and health care are maintained.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2816"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>Etopos was founded on a feudal system. Tribal leaders formed into nations and from there became a World Government. The process from warring tribes to a World Government took many centuries and many bloody wars. But had settled to the modern and fairly peaceful system by the Etopians equivalent of the twentieth century. Hence they never experienced an World Wars. Farming was an easy task on Etopos, very rarely will a plant struggle. Those who didn't farm the land farmed the seas. The only problem that drove farmers to become creative was the weather on Etopos. Hence Etopian Scientists developed methods of controlling the weather early on in their industrial age.</p><p>Etopian biology was also far in advance of earth's of a similar era. The desire to protect their planet from the ravages of industry were spotted much earlier on Etopos than on Earth but the method they came up with took longer to develop. Having concentrated more on the bio sciences, it took a few extra years to firstly catch up on the physical sciences and then come up with methods that would cause least damage to their planet. In the end the desire to move heavy industry off the planet and the need to place weather control satellites in space forced the Etopians into a Space Age.</p><p>Then a desire to not overcrowd their planet encouraged the nations to fund programs exploring space and developing the colonisation program. From there the discovery of warp quickly followed with the desire to travel between the first colony and the Homeworld more rapidly. Shortly after their discovery of Warp the Federation made first contact and Etopos joined the Federation. For the Etopian's planet history see Etopos Planet entry.</p><p>TREXITE COLONY- Unlike their Homeworld Etopos, Trexite has had to keep their industry on planet. But following the lead of the Homeworld they have ensured that it does not affect their natural environment. One trick was to move some of the industry into the domed cities as the people moved out. The people of Trexite refer to themselves as Trexans. Their economic and political systems are very similar in nature to those of the Homeworld. Being close to the Homeworld has meant that strong ties have remained between the two worlds. Trade between the two planets continues and benefits both planets.</p><p>MUSTINE COLONY- Mustine has not faired so well. Partly due to fewer people choosing to move to the planet and partly due to problems of ill health that have beset the colonists. In the beginning whilst living in the domes the colonists did not fair so badly but on moving outside poor health became a norm. Crops struggled to thrive and with the colonists poor health it was difficult to develop as quickly as Trexite had. During the first hundred years when Etopos supported the colony these problems were offset by supplies and services from the Homeworld. But since independence was declared the colony has been struggling. Etopian scientists have declared that the health problems are related to something on the planet but cannot yet define what. Teams were sent to investigate but since independence the Mustines have been left to their own devices. Contact between the Homeworld and Mustine has been very limited since independence and there is much bad feeling.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-ferengi"></a>Ferengi</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Mike</span> <span class="surname">Rouse-Deane</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">6 March 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

The homeworld is called Ferenginar, an M-class planet with a wet climate. Ferengis are slight for humanoid races, rarely passing 5 feet in stature. Ferengi have ascending ribs and an upper and lower lung. Primary facial features are their ridged nose, razor-sharp fangs, and highly sensitive ears, but their main deviation from ordinary humanoid physiology is the four-lobed design of the brain, whose unusual patterns prevent telepaths such as the Betazoids from reading their mind. Dopterians, whose brains are structurally similar to those of the Ferengi, are similarly unreadable by Betazoids.</p><p>The other uniquely Ferengi characteristic is the large ears that are receptive to touch. Their homeworld of Ferenginar has a thin atmosphere, and in time the Ferengi ears grew larger to better receive sound waves. The lobes are receptive to touch, and fondling them, termed oo-mox, is pleasurable to most males. The ears also have fine hairs on them, which with age grows to be lengthy and even shaggy. Hearing is undoubtedly the finest tuned sense of a Ferengi, and the ears unmistakably symbolize their innate "Ferenginess". One who has the "lobes" for something is marked out as gifted. Female lobes are smaller than normal male Ferengi.</p><p>Eating habits- Ferengis delight in worms and various insects, preferably alive and squirming. The one caveat is, insects must come from Ferenginar, or it isn't food at all. Their small and sharp teeth make them efficient eaters. When young Ferengis need to sharpen dull teeth they use latinum tooth-sharpeners or chew-sticks.</p><p>Interestingly, Ferengi males often find human females very attractive. Ferengi consider pregnancy to be a rental, with the father being termed the lessee. When a young Ferengi reaches adulthood and prepares to leave home, he traditionally raises capital by auctioning his boyhood treasures.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2913"></a>Society</h3></div></div></div><p>Up to the appointment of Grand Nagus Rom, their culture, which has existed for thousands of years, was founded upon capitalism but taken to such an extreme that every aspect of society, no matter how trivial, is based on money and the pursuit of profit.</p><p>Other races see Ferengi as ruthlessly exploitive, but while Ferengi exploit, embezzle, and double-cross people and often act without scruple in business deals they are in fact behaving according to set rules. It is assumed that Rom, a progressive in favour of humanising these principles, would make sweeping changes. But until then Ferengi rules and principles are enshrined in 285 rules together called The Rules of Acquisition. These rules were written by the first Nagus, Grint, who founded the Ferengi Alliance we know today.</p><p>The Ferengi have a strict code of honor. The Ferengi culture finds the concept of organised labor to be abhorrent, since such things can interfere with the exploitation of workers. A Ferengi labor contracts never provides sick leave, vacations, or paid overtime for employees. Ferengi consider the sanctity of a contract to be a cornerstone of their civilization. Breaking a contract in unthinkable, and will generally result in the offender having his Ferengi business license revoked and all of his assets seized, and him becoming a pariah in Ferengi society.</p><p>Ferengi's see death as another opportunity to get money and so the body, instead of having an autopsy, which is strictly prohibited, is cut into small pieces that are sealed into a disk-shaped souvenir contain, and then sold. These disks become valuable collector's items if the dead Ferengi was a personage of note. A Ferengi Certificate of Dismemberment accompanies the couvenir, stating the name of the person's remains. Ferengi believe that those who earned a profit during their mortal lives can enter the Divine Treasury after death. There, under the guidance of the Blessed Excheque, the Celestial Auctioneers allow them to bid on new lives. Those who haven't earned profit are thought to be doomed to the Vault of Eternal Destitution.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2924"></a>Females</h3></div></div></div><p>Ferengi are a sexist society. The Ferengi male views his female as property not to be shared nor exposed to the public. Females are not allowed an article clothing, earning of profit, traveling, looking or speaking to strangers, or even quoting from the sacred Rules of Acquisition. Another demeaning practice females are subjected to is chewing food for the males. This inbred sexism is sanctioned in several Rules Of Aquisition. Even so, a Ferengi regards his mother with affection, often taking comfort in laying his head in her lap and defending her honor against the taunts of mean-spirited playmates.</p><p>Small nuclear families consisting of the father, mother, and children makes up the family structure of Ferengi society. Grandparents and cousins do not live within the same household. The father figure is the sole bread-earner, so his position is supreme in the house. Quark, Deep Space Nine's bartender has an exceptionally unique mother because of she believed that females should have rights like Ferengi males and so changed the Ferengi government near the end of Grand Nagus Zek's term to allow female Ferengi' to work. Ferengi marriages are male-oriented, with a string of Latinum Dances, Bridal Auctions, and of course the scantily clad bride to mark the event. The total enslavement of the female population seems to come quite natural to the males, and they even attribute their family harmony to such a culture. However, affirmative action seems to have come into vogue even in Ferenginar. Grand Nagus Zek revised the Ferengi Bill of Opportunities to include female Ferengis. Understandably, Ferengi culture is still adapting to the sweeping winds of change.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2931"></a>Government</h3></div></div></div><p>In government, the Ferengis are as openly corrupt as they are in daily life. The Tower of Commerce on Ferenginar, the tallest building within the Ferengi Alliance, is the bastion of profit-taking and scheming. Going up the tower in an elevator will cost seven slips of latinum. Talking to the front desk will mean another slip. Standing, sitting, coming, going, the Tower absolutely swallows latinum with unparalleled voracity. Housed within the Tower of Commerce is the headquarters of the Ferengi Commerce Association (FCA), the most powerful single organization within the Alliance. It is the terror of the land, as is has jurisdiction over every aspect of a Ferengi's profit and property. Every Ferengi must submit a yearly statement listing all the profits earned that year. Most Ferengis conveniently "forget" to put a few items on the list, and that is where the Ferengi IRS personnel come in. Registered Liquidators are sent in to investigate charges of misreported profits, and if evidence is found, or the bribe insufficient, all the property and holdings will be summarily liquidated.</p><p>Ferengi's have a salvage code which states that anything found abandoned is open to claim by those who find it. The Ferengi who took over the Enterprise-D in 2369 tried to claim the ship under this very same code. The Ferengi have two main types of vessel, the Ferengi Marauder (D'Kora class) which is quoted to have a weapon that is able to destroy a Federation Galaxy class vessel. These ships also have smaller vessels which are classed as Ferengi Pods. The Marauder were designed to allow 450 Ferengi's aboard. A Ferengi shuttle is a two person transport, also known as the Ferengi pod. These shuttles are carried aboard Ferengi Marauders.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2938"></a>Grand Nagus</h3></div></div></div><p>The Grand Nagus is the Ferengi master of commerce. The Grand Nagus has enormous power over Ferengi business, controlling the allocation of trade territories and other commercial opportunities. When a Nagus dies, his body is immediately vacuum-desiccated and pieces are sold as collectors items at handsome prices. The Grand Nagus carries an ornate cane symbolizing his high rank. The cane features a sculpted Ferengi head made of gold at its top. It is customary to honor the Nagus by kissing the head of the cane. The first Grand Nagus was Gint, the ancient entrepreneur who first devised the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition that guide Ferengi commerce. Grand Nagus Zek being tired of the affairs of state chose Rom as his successor, a decision which reflected his goal of remaking Ferengis into a kinder, gentler race. With a person as decent and nice as Rom as Grand Nagus, the Alliance would see sweeping changes to curb the greed and bad reputation of Ferengis. With the end of the Dominion War accompanying Rom's ascension to the post of Grand Nagus, a new day truly has dawned on Ferenginar.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2943"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>The Ferengi originate from the planet Ferenginar. 10,000 years passed before the squabbling Ferengi-populated planets finally united to form the Ferengi Alliance, their present governing system. By the 2300's, Ferengi acquired warp drive technology and could engage in interstellar travels. The Alliance is ruled by the Grand Nagus, recognized as the greatest merchant and slyest manipulator in the Quadrant. The Grand Nagus possess the power to rewrite the Rules of Acquisition, which sets in print many useful and ruthless principles of capitalism to be employed by all Ferengi. These rules, of which there are currently 285, are memorized and taken to heart by every Ferengi boy at a young age.</p><p>The Federation knew very little of the Ferengi Alliance until first contact was made in 2364 at the planet Delphi Ardu. The Ferengi encountered by the away-team of the Enterprise-D wielded stunning whips, snarled viciously, hissed incomprehensible remarks, and was quite unsociable. However, though hostile at first, Ferengi soon realized the market potential the Federation had to offer and many have established businesses on Federation planets and starbases.</p><p>Shortly after first contact with the Federation, Ferengi entrepreneurs saw new opportunities and quickly assimilated themselves into Federation commerce, such as Quark, a Ferengi who established a bar at Deep Space 9. The Ferengi are not members of the Federation. Ferengi entrepreneurs served as intermediaries for the Karemma in commerce with the Federation. The Karemma sought this arrangement because the Dominion would not have tolerated direct trade with the Federation. One Ferengi quotation says, "Never ask when you can take." Another Ferengi saying is, "Good things come in small packages". A terrible financial decline struck in the mid 24th century, causing rampant inflation and currency devaluation. This catastrophe became known as the Great Monetary Collapse. During the Dominion war, when most of the Alpha Quadrant powers were battling the Dominion threat pouring in from the Gamma Quadrant, the Ferengi Alliance blissfully stayed neutral, content to rake their profit even when chaos abounds just by the side. War for other worlds is expensive, long, and detrimental to internal economy, so why engage in war?</p><p>In 2374, at one time there were two Naguses in power: Zek and Brunt. Zek had lost his power when his amendment of the Ferengi Bill of Opportunities to give females the right to wear clothing resulted in planetary chaos on Ferenginar and he was removed from office. Brunt became now Acting Grand Nagus, a temporary position which could have been made permanent if the FCA followed through and gave him the title of full Nagus. Zek succeeded in getting the FCA to reinstate him, through the allure and intelligence of "Lumba". Zek successfully regained his position, and he carried out a series of amendments to the Bill of Rights, such as taxation to fund social welfare programs and environmental protection. Ishka is heavily suspected to have been the driving force behind these unprecedented legislation, and great upheaval accompanied each amendment. As Quark puts it: Ferenginar will soon be like the Federation.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-flarn"></a>Flarn</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Larry</span> <span class="surname">Garfield</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">12 April 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

Their only other identifying feature is a brow ridge that runs from their left ear up to their forehead and across the forehead, to descent symmetrically on the other side to their right ear. All males have chocolate brown hair, while all females have white hair.</p><p>Male Flarn are stronger and more muscular than their female counterparts, and as such make up the bulk of their armed forces. However, the 26% of the military that is female is quite feared, even by their male comrades. It is possible that the maternal instinct is part of the increased aggressiveness of the Flarn female over the male of the species. A female Flarn is more likely to shoot first and ask questions later.</p><p>A typical Flarn is stronger than their human counterpart, roughly on par with an angry Vulcan. However, there is no such concept as "honor" or a "fair fight" in Flarn culture, so they have no qualms about foregoing their physical advantage to shoot someone in the back with a disruptor. Flarn are decidedly self-interested, aggressive, and ambitious. Every Flarn's lifelong dream is to be supreme despot of the universe, simply for the power trip involved. However, pragmatism typically keeps them loyal to their chosen military, making bribery difficult in most cases.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e3030"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>The Flarn are a warrior race that spent most of their history at war with themselves. As such, they devoted most of their scientific endeavors to machines of war. They apparently developed photon torpedoes before they developed space ships to put them on. The entire planet was unified only in 2343, when one faction developed basic space travel. They used their new power to oppress the rest of the factions, and have since formed a single, cohesive, militaristic oligarchy.</p><p>As they are new to space travel, their fastest ships are capable of only warp 3.2 sustained, and 3.6 max for 2 hours. However, due to their violent history and lengthy arms race, their weapons and shielding are superior to Starfleet's.</p><p>The Flarn are the sole species in the small Flarn Regime.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-komunicaton"></a>Komunicaton</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Jason</span> <span class="surname">Lee</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">1 December 2001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

Specifically, the Kommunicatons received an Earth signal but Earth was not aware of that fact. Features to Kommunicatons are larger ears than humans but smaller than Ferengi. Mouths are slightly larger as well than other Terrans. These two differences are what a Kommunicaton stand out from human beings. Their social ability and their charisma make them very likable. Starfleet doctors guess that their charisma comes from their genes. This ability will make the toughest and meanest alien creatures like them almost instantly. This ability is somewhat equivalent to a popular person or very successful diplomat.</p><p>The Kommunicatons translated their alien name as close as to our language as possible. Generally, a Kommunicaton is one who loves to talk and does it well. It would be abnormal for a Kommunicaton not socialize for a period of the day. It is said that the reason that a Kommunicaton has large ears and a large mouth is to speak well and to listen attentively. It might be said that if other races met a Kommunicaton, one would describe them as very talkative. The Kommunicatons' ability of charisma can be explained as one who is genetically born likable. A combination of pheromones and the genetic ability to smooth talk can closely define as the charisma.</p><p>For example, if a Kommunicaton were to talk to an alien who was outraged at that Kommunicaton, the after a few seconds talking to the alien, the alien would calm down and like the Kommunicaton. To put it this way, a Kommunicaton does not emote calm, rather a Kommunicaton emote friendship. This charisma is similar to a telepathic impression that leaves the other person in a good mood and good relations to the Kommunicaton. The Kommunicatons Government is a republic type of government, one much like the United States' government on Earth. It is guessed that the Kommunicatons modeled their government after the United States because of The Signal's message with some minor changes.</p><p>The Kommunicatons Culture is one full of pleasantries. Their culture involves mainly talking, so all forms of games and any type of culture involves socializing in one form or another. Their matter of dress is remarkably simple and comfortable. Kommunicatons have a relatively simple way of life. Since contact by Earth, most jobs are geared toward for scientific research and improvement of Kommunicaton life. Currency is almost nonexistent; the only real currency that is accounted for is an energy quota. This energy quota maybe used for special items or special food items. Items that do not require the energy quota are free and usually supplied by the government. One item of interest that is carried by every Kommunicaton is a compact audio/video communications device. First contact with the Kommunicatons have been made by the USS Aztec and its crew with Captain Kenson Xu.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e3116"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>Kommunicatons have a relatively similar technological history to Earth. As for cultural history, Kommunicatons were divided into 20 nations over 20 different islands and continents. Although Kommunicatons were divided into 20 nations, Kommunicatons never had a war between the nations. Due to their nature of their charisma, no Kommunicaton could get angry enough at another Kommunicaton to actually fight a war. Their technological progress halted at the technological level of the 1960s and stayed at that level for about 200 years. Their technological level excluded computers, but did include the combustible engine, the radio, the television, etc. For those 200 years, Kommunicatons scientists proclaimed that technology could not be advanced anymore. </p><p>In the Earth year of 2021, the Kommunicatons picked up a stray radio signal from Earth. Unknown to the Kommunicatons, this signal traveled through an unstable temporal shifting wormhole which shortly collapsed after the signal when through. Their culture latched on the idea to contacting Earth, which all research methods to communications. As a culture and historical icon, the radio signal is referred as "The Signal" and is revered as something sacred. Interesting enough, subspace communications was invented before the warp drive. Kommunicatons only can guess about the wormhole because of the fact that they are missing a star from their nightly skyline on their world. Pictures of the skyline before and after The Signal differ by a single star. Kommunicaton scientists can only guess that the object that was missing from the sky was responsible for delivering the signal. This wormhole was stable at the Kommunicaton's end but shifted at the other end.</p><p>The Signal's message contained mathematical formulas and other things that described where the message was coming from. The basic gist of the message was, "Greetings from the Planet Earth! We come in peace and have sent this message in search for other intelligent beings. We hope and wait for your reply." One of the mathematical formulas described how to find the Sol System from the center of the galactic origin point. In addition, there was extraneous information such as the United States Constitution, biological information about man, and some technological highlights from the 1960s. The Kommunicatons to this date have colonized their home system in addition to two neighboring systems and have made contact with two other races. Although their subspace communications is quite advanced which can contact any race within half a quadrant distance, their government decided to limit contact with other races and focus on the main goal of contacting Earth.</p><p>The Kommunicatons have developed advanced data compression techniques for communications purposes which allow the transmission of high volumes of data within a small period of time. In addition, these compression techniques are relatively simple for most computers to decompress quickly. Before their invention of the warp drive, the Kommunicatons invented an equivalent to the Starfleet transporter in the 2360s. Transporter technology is a relatively new technology, and is not generally trusted. After the invention of the transporter came the basic warp drive. Since this technology is still new, the Kommunicatons have only the limited warp capacity of warp 1. In the 2370s, the Kommunicatons intercepted Voyager's communications to and from Earth. Today, in 2377, the Kommunicatons have made first contact. They have sent a representative, by the name of Jagon, over to Earth using their data compression techniques, and their relatively new transporter technology.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-o"></a>O</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Philip</span> <span class="surname">Stonness</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">22 April 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

They are similar to the Bynars in which the Bynars are based in pairs. The Quasians have an entire system based in 32. A Lenta is roughly equal to 32 inches, and a Pounta is equal to roughly 32 Pounds. The Quasian calendar is a most remarkable one, and very precise to their planet's rotation around their special star. One Quasian Year has 10 months, with each month having exactly 32 days. Each Quanta, the name given to a Quasian year and their star, is about 485 Earth days. The Quasians have an interesting set up of time as well. Each Quasian day has 32 hours, each Quasian hour has 64 minutes and each Quasian second has 64 seconds.</p><p>The Quasian spelling for their units is not far off from English, just that it is slightly cut and has 'ta' on the end. A few examples are dta -Quasian day, minuta - Quasian minute, secota - Quasian second, mota - Quasian month.</p><p>Their holy theory, as they call it, is the Quasian Way of Life. This way of life is actually a scientific theory about how one interact with 31 other selves. It is said that a computer is run on only two out of 32 states of an electron, while a Quantum computer is run on all 32 states of the electron. Quasians are living Quantum computers. They exist in a Quantum flux, and if one had the chance to run a scan over a Quasian, one would discover that there was the existence of 31 other dimensions in where the Quasian was standing.</p><p>Quasians have white hair, and may have beards, but beards are usually reserved for the wisest people or those part of the important aspects of their scientific community. Quasians bluish purplish skin, and their eye colors vary from yellow, black, and blue. Quasians are mainly thin, and have large heads. They do not have muscular builds because it is usually looked down upon. The Quasian culture is one built on the focus of the mind and the ability to think with the other 31 dimensions which is part of them. Quasians are not imposing any manner. One would say that the Quasians primarily keep to themselves and answer only when asked.</p><p>Their star system only has one true planet orbiting their one star. However, under close scans, one would discover their were actually 32 planets orbiting their star and that each planet was similar to the one that seemed to be the only planet in the system. It is because of this unique star and the way that the other planets seem to interact with the multiverse that this particular culture can exist with 31 other selves. Other than the odd fact that each Quasian has 31 other selves, they are normal like any other humanoids and have females and males.</p><p>The Quasians are an advanced race, with computers beyond that of the Federation. They do not have warp capacity but they have the technology to something far more advanced to the Quantum Slipstream. The Quasians are almost complete in developing a device known as the Quantum Transporter that transports something by manipulating the quantum level to travel. The transporter uses a similar theory of what humans theorized about the Hyper Drive. However, the transporter is much more advanced in that when research is completed, the Quasians would be able to travel anywhere from point A in the galaxy to point B in an instant, no matter how far the distance. As their communications is not on the similar level, the Quasians do not dare to risk travel beyond the galaxy.</p><p>The Quasian government is an orderly and organized one, consisting of 32 representatives as a collective council for their planet. These 32 representatives are usually the 32 wisest and smartest people of all Quasians. This council is usually referred as the Quantar. Under the council, there are 32 committees that do various administrative tasks ordered by the council. These committees have 32 people each, and are either hired or voted by the people into office. In the event of an emergency or a disagreement, the 32 committees may meet, vote for one representative for each committee and form the Quasian Council of Agreement. The Quasian Council of Agreement is made of the 32 original representatives plus the 32 elected representatives of committees. The Council may include up to 32 elective representatives of the people, if the need arises. The Quasian Council requires 2/3 in agreement of all those present.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e3391"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>The Quasian history, or historta, is mostly filled with the discovery of science and the existence of the other 31 selves. The Quasians know that their history stretchs for at least 500,000 Earth years and they evolved from a similar animal akin to the Earth's dolphins. The Quasians have two ages, the first age they refer as The Age of Awareness. This is age is considered as a dark age when their race were savage and not aware of the other 31 selves. The Age of Awareness was filled with wars and uneducated people. It was not until 3000 Quanta ago that a sciencist named Quanas proposed a theory about the view of their planet that the system existed on 32 dimensional planets that intersected each other. This theory was developed into fact 10 Quanta later. After what they mark as The Discovery, the Quasians were able to united as one planet. The theory was able to advance the Quasians to make them see beyond their old petty differences. They discovered that their star has 32 planets in the same circular orbit as their planet, rotating in different angles. They were not able to see it at first without the aid of a special visual device, but now every Quasian can see the other 32 dimensions. Within a few Motas, the Quasians were able to develop a device in which interacted between parallel dimensions so they could communication with the other 31 selves. As time progressed, Quasians were able to communication almost instantly with their other selves. With each improvement, the Quasians can now think and hold a great deal of knowledge.</p><p>When the Quasians went to explore space, they found that their was one large problem. One of these problems was the fact that they discovered they could not maintain contact with their other selves. The first Quasians in space went insane and died shortly after. When the space craft crashed back to the planet's surface, the Quasians were able to resolve the problem with a dimensional device in which they were around their necks. As time progressed, the dimensional device became part of jewelery, such as necklaces and bracelets. The Quasians never dared to settle on other planets in fear that their dimensional devices would break down, so they only explored the galaxy to exchange information. They have explored only limited of their space, and do not dare to interfere with other alien races. The Quasians try to keep to themselves, and tried to develop faster ways of transportation in order to increase their range of going to a certain point and returning home just as fast. They have not been successful in developing a large scale dimensional device to encompass a larger area. The Quasians have not yet met the Dominion, and it is apparent that the Dominion is a bit farther away. The Quasians have heard of the Dominion, however, they are trying their best to avoid the Dominion.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-talosian"></a>Talosian</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Mike</span> <span class="surname">Rouse-Deane</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">6 March 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

The Talosians are a powerful dominant humanoid culture, who have lived on Talos 4 for many years. The Talosians during their history were nearly killed by a nuclear war, however a few survivors clung to life in underground caves and passageways. During the time in these caves, the Talosians became dependent upon creating illusions using mind as well as technology from their ancestors.</p><p>By the mid-23rd century, the Talosians resorted to capturing passing travellers to serve as a new source for illusions. The Talosians enjoyed sharing the experiences of those aliens they had collected prior to the war, but this became a dangerous narcotic for them. They came to rely on their fantasy life more and more, eventually losing almost all touch with reality. Meanwhile, their technology crumbled and decayed around them to leave them all but helpless. There has been no further contact with the Talosians due to General Order 7 which states: "No Starfleet vessel shall visit the planet Talos IV under any circumstances, emergency or otherwise. This order supersedes General Order 6. Any transgression of this general order shall be punishable by death."</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e3477"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>The Talosian response was to bring aliens to their world, hoping to select appropriate specimens and use them to breed an entire race of slaves to maintain their society whilst they continued to enjoy their telepathic fantasy lives. The first encounter between Talosians and Humanity came when the SS Columbia crashed on Talos IV in 2236. All the crew were killed except for one woman, Vina, who was badly injured. The Talosians repaired her injuries, but although they found Humans to be an ideal physical choice for their slaves they were not able to proceed with their plans for a further 18 years due to the lack of any male candidate, which was to be Captain Christopher Pike.</p><p>In 2254, the Talosians captured the USS Enterprise, then under the command of Captain Christopher Pike, in an attempt to create a permanent human community with a female Vina, which was captured after her ship crashed on the planet several years earlier. But Pike was resistant to being kept in a cell, so the Talosians believed that they were unsuitable subjects for their needs. Nevertheless, in 2266, the Talosians invited Pike to return to their world after an accident left him disabled. At Talos, illusions made it possible for Pike to live out the remainder of his life unfettered by the damage of his body. Since this time there has been no further contact with the Talosians. Presumably their society is still decaying, although the presence of a Human male and female may mean that a small group of Humans was produced after all.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-tholian"></a>Tholian</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Mike</span> <span class="surname">Rouse-Deane</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">27 January 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

In appearance they are multifaceted solids, apparently existing at a very high temperature. Tholians tend to be aggressive, territorial and extremely punctual beings who do not welcome intrusions into their space. A silk, known as Tholian silk, is highly prized as it is virtually frictionless and is known to be made within their homeworld, Tholia.</p><p>They are highly advanced sentient beings, apparently crystalline species, non-humanoid in appearance and extremely territorial in disposition. They hail from a hot planet by Human standards, probably not Class-M. Together, two Tholian ships can literally spin a web of energy in space in order to trap an enemy vessel, after which the web is then drawn together, constricting and finally destroying the vessel inside.</p><p>On stardate 5693.2, the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 made first contact with this species. Tholians are a hive-mind and known for their punctuality. One of the independent border races that could have been dragged into a Klingon civil war, due to their proximity. During a period of renewed conflict with the United Federation of Planets in 2253, they attacked a starbase and killed the entire complement, except civilian advisor Kyle Riker, who refused to give up survival. In a battle simulation during his Academy days, Riker figured out the sensory blind spot of a Tholian ship and hid there. However, tensions have eased enough for the Tholians to send an ambassador to space station Deep Space Nine, in talks with the Federation for hopefully peace with the species.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e3565"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>The USS Enterprise encountered the Tholians in 2267 while investigating the loss of the USS Defiant in an interphase region. The Tholians demanded an explanation for the Starship's presence, and initially agreed to allow the Enterprise to remain in the area. When the ship was unable to provide proof of the Defiant's presence in the area the Tholians attacked the ship. The Enterprise proved militarily superior to the Tholian vessels, but was almost trapped within one of the forcefield webs, a system designed to enclose a vessel within a network virtually unbreakable strands.</p><p>In 2353 the Tholians attacked and nearly destroyed a Federation starbase, killing all but one of its complement. As recently as 2355 tensions remained high enough that Starfleet routinely trained against Tholian warships in simulations. Tensions remained sufficiently high that it was feared that they might become involved in the Klingon civil war, but eventually relations with the Federation were established and in 2371 a Tholian Ambassador visited Deep Space Nine. A Tholian observer was present at the ill fated Antwerp conference on Earth in 2372 when a bomb destroyed the conference hall.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="species-trill"></a>Trill</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Philip</span> <span class="surname">Stonness</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">25 March 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

Trills have spotted skin areas beside the vertical hairline that follow down the Trill body.</p><p>The symbiont body is a foot-long purplish lump of cranial and exoskeletal tissue, some are susceptible to damage by transporter beam. In emergencies, a symbiont can survive in stasis for only a matter of two hours maximum. In extreme cases, a human body can serve as a temporary host for no more then a few days.</p><p>Since the symbiont integrates each new host's personality with its own after joining, Trill relationships are often hard for single-unit species to deal with and sometimes don't survive the change and thus a relationship that existed with a previous host is discouraged for a host. Trills are usually very responsible and moderate or reserved in personality; the symbionts don't seek romance and try to adhere to a "higher plane," feeling it a nuisance and a weakness of the young - although the host body occasionally indulges. The symbiont does carry memories of time shared with each of its hosts, except this does not mean a joined Trill carries the responsibilites and obligations a previous host did, and each new combination - aside from gender, height and weight - carries a different blood type, metabolism, nervous system, and brain wave pattern. The complex brain carries two cerebral nuclei - one in each being, linked together - whose brain wave patterns can each be scanned separately as well as together. The two are biologically interdependent; at 93 hours after their joining, neither can survive without the other. A Trill host's hands feel cold-blooded to the touch; their more overtly developed senses include identifying a known individual only by the audible rhythm of footsteps.</p><p>The humanoid host species' unruly children are not above throwing rocks at windows, just like their Human and Bajoran counterparts, at least. To other races, Trill may seem arrogant side. Only one Trill in ten is chosen to be joined to the "thousands" of symbionts, but those not joined still lead normal, productive lives. The brains of hosts produce endorphins as in the human brain. Thousands of symbionts live on Trill. Joined Trills are allergic to insect bites, since the biochemical connections of the symbiont and host can't tolerate the toxins. They are more resistant to a noxious paralyzing volcanic gas found on planet LS VI than other humanoids such as Bajorans. Among outworlders, they have been in contact with Klingons at least since 2289.</p><p>A Trill's lineal or family name follows the given name, as is done on Earth, but a host drops his lineal name in favor of the symbiont's. People at the Symbiosis Commission worry that the symbionts would be bartered as commodities if the truth were known that half the population could be hosts, rather than the 1-in-1,000 ratio officially quoted and the reason behind the rigorous selection and training program.

This natural phenomenon has created a planet that is only habitable in a zone of the meridian separating the day and night sides. The entire planet is heavily coated in severe ionized storms, which make subspace communications, scanning, and transporters, ineffective from orbit.

Nearly smack in the center of the Gulf's unexplored vastness lay one inhabited world, the fourth planet of the politically nonaligned Chairos system.

The larger sun has ten planets in orbit, the smaller sun, four. The small sun orbits around the larger sun. Etopos standard year is equivalent to roughly two Earth years. The moons have both been terraformed and support small populations of miners, industrialists and ship builders. Etopos is described as a garden paradise, there is no heavy industry, no poverty and life is very similar to that found on Earth of the 24th Century. The planet is a fertile garden world, with about two thirds of the planet being sea. The Etopians are expert farmers and worked out around four centuries ago how to control their weather. From these experiments developed the industry the planet is famous for, terraforming technology.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e3820"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>Etopos began to reach out to space over four hundred Terran years ago. Starting first by creating domed colonies on their moons. The moons were found to be rich in minerals so the Etopians moved all heavy industry to these two large natural satellites. Then added a space station and finally a ship dockyard. Here the first deep space exploration ships and then the first colony ships were built and sent out to Trexite. Travel at this time was done in impulse ships, warp had yet to be discovered. It was the development of a successful colony that helped to push along the development of Warp Drive. The Trexite colony was where various terraforming techniques were first used to change the planet from Class K to Class M. </p><p>In the years it took to force these changes the colonists lived in domed communities. It was during the first Warp Drive tests that the planet Mustine was found orbiting the smaller sun in the binary system. The Etopians later sent out colony ships to the planet Mustine a Class M planet. Ten Earth years after the colony on Mustine was set up Etopos joined the Federation. The Etopians shared their knowledge of terraforming techniques and in return gained knowledge about replicators and transporters The Trexite colony is approximately 200 Earth years old, the Mustine colony 150 Earth years old. Trexite is a thriving colony that gained independence from Etopos one hundred Earth years ago. Mustine is much smaller, and is struggling. It has been independent from Etopos for fifty Earth years.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="location-galactic_barrier"></a>Galactic Barrier</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Philip</span> <span class="surname">Stonness</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">23 May 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

It consists of several forms of energy, including mass quantities of psionic energy. This type of energy is not common.</p><p>When a starship enters this field, the excess energy causes power disruption and overloads throughout the ship. Prolonged exposure to the Galactic Barrier may ultimately lead to a ship's destruction.</p><p>To add to this problem, psionic energy disrupts and overloads neurons in a typical human brain in much the same manner as damage to the ship. While within the Galactic Barrier, a ship's crew will get headaches and extreme fatigue if in the barrier for only a matter of moments, and can cause insanity and even death if prolonged exposure to the barrier occurs.</p><p>Usually, the more telepathic a humanoid the more symptoms are intensified. The only exception to this rule are Vulcans, who apparently are not affected by the barrier at all.</p><p>This field can easily be compared the Great Barrier, a similar energy field surrounding the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e3887"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>There are only four instances known to the federation in which a vessel has entered the Galactic Barrier.</p><p>Once by the S.S. Valiant on a mission of exploration. Their original purpose was to come to the edge of the galaxy, then head back. When they arrived at the galaxy's rim, they encountered an energy field known now as the Galactic Barrier. Their flight recorder was later discovered by the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701.</p><p>There were three entries made by the original Enterprise.</p><p>Once after discovering the S.S. Valiant's lost flight recorder in the year 2267. The Enterprise found that the Valiant crew had destroyed themselves in order to prevent takeover of the Federation by some of it's crew. The Enterprise, not knowing what was going on, entered the Barrier in search of answers. A friend of Captain Kirk's who had latent psionic abilities was apparently affected by the barrier's energy, and started to display abnormal telepathic abilities. This individual soon started speaking of ruling all of the Federation(just as the Valiant crew had). Eventually, Kirk had to kill his friend.</p><p>In 2268, another entry and exit was accomplished when alien life-forms named the 'Kelvan', who's home planet was located in a neighboring galaxy, hijacked the Enterprise. The Kelvans' mission was to find a suitable new home for their race, however their vessel was destroyed by the Galactic Barrier. Tricking the Enterprise crew into landing on the planet at which they now had crashed on, using their advanced technology they captured the Enterprise. They transformed the majority of the crew into dodecahedrons, leaving only essential personnel aboard including Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, Chief Surgeon Leanard McCoy, Chief Science Officer Spock, and Captain James Kirk. They exited the galaxy en route to the Kelvans' homeworld, but soon was thwarted by the remaining Star-Fleet crew. The crew returned to their humanoid shape, and the Enterprise returned within it's own galaxy.</p><p>Finally, once more in 2269 did the original Enterprise enter the Barrier. At the current time, their was a meducian ambassador visiting the ship with two assistants: Dr. Jones, and an individual named Maverick. Maverick was driven insane by jealousy, and took control of the Enterprise' engines, which he had helped design, and piloted the massive starship across the Barrier. Eventually, Chief Science Officer Spock had to perform a mind-meld with the meducian ambassador, considering the ambassador was the only one who knew how to pilot the ship safely out into and out of the Galactic Barrier again. After the mind-meld Kollos, using Spock's body, successfully piloted the Enterprise back into the Milky Way Galaxy.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="location-khitomer"></a>Khitomer</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Amanda</span> <span class="surname">Noon</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">27 October 2001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

It is generally red in colour, due to the concentration of iron present in Mars' atmosphere and the outer layer of soil. This planet has many canyons believed to have once carried water throughout the planet.</p><p>The 'red planet' lies at an average of 227,936,640 Kilometers from Sol. It's volume, or size, and gravity are both approximately 1/10th that of Earth(Sol III). A Martian year is about double that of Earth's, at about one revolution per 687 terran days. Martian days are about 25 hours each.</p><p>Mars has many colonies that house thousands of people. One such colony is Martian Colony 3.</p><p>Because of the extremely thin air within Mars' atmosphere and low gravity, sub-orbital flight is made easy in comparison with other inhabited planets in general.</p><p>In orbit and on the surface is the Utopia Plantitia Ship Yards. This installation launched many famous ships, such as the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D and U.S.S. Voyager.</p><p>Adding to the defense of Sector 001 is the 'Mars Defense perimeter', a series of small unmanned craft designed to protect the inner planets of the Sol system. This perimeter was easily thwarted however by the Borg in 2367 after a cube destroyed more then 30 ships at Wolf 359.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e4072"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>It was first settled by humans in the year 2103, 40 years after warp drive was invented. The first settlements were designed after the "Millennium Gate", a large self-sufficient commercial center built on Earth in the late 20th century. Martian rights were dictated by the Fundamental Declaration of the Martian Colonies. However, this planet was hardly free of crime at this point in history. At that time there was a serial killer that murdered many women. This madman, 200 years later, was found out to be an alien entity feeding off of fear from it's victims. This discovery was made by the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701.</p><p>Early in Mars' history was the Ares IV spacecraft, it was of the Mars modules in service by NASA. It went missing early in the 21st century. No human had known what happened to the capsule or how it disappeared, but this mystery was soon unraveled by the U.S.S. Voyager while in the Delta Quadrant. Voyager encountered a massive moving sub-space 'cloud' or 'storm' that had been moving through space for eons. Upon closer investigation, it was found that the Ares IV has been entrapped by the storm. The Voyager crew soon found that the astronaut that had piloted Ares IV had survived being inside the storm for several days after his entrapment.</p><p>Physical exploration of this minute planet began in the late 20th century, where NASA and the Soviet Union sent many unmanned probes to gather valuable data on Mars. On of the most famous is the Pathfinder project(a massive project launched by NASA), which brought back many photographs of the planet's surface and other valuable data. In 1996, NASA released information pertaining to a meteorite that was thought to be from Mars. This rock housed fossils of micro organisms, which was thought to be evidence of life on Mars.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="location-obaine"></a>Obaine Nebula</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Mike</span> <span class="surname">Rouse-Deane</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">18 April 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

The people of Pilton are generally isolationist, preferring local interaction to full participation in the interstellar Federation. Pilton is small enough to not to merit full membership in the Federation, though it is something akin to a "territory" or "possession."</p><p>The planet itself has one major landmass and many outlying islands in a very large ocean. The islands are uninhabited. The continent is in the northern hemisphere and has three coasts -- south, east, and west. Coastal land is arable but as one moves toward the interior, it becomes more mountainous and 2000km inland the mountains peak. On the other side of this half-ring of mountains, in the central and north-central interior of the continent, is desolate land -- desert in the center, tundra in the north-center.</p><p>The livable land consists primarily of farms and villages -- with one major city, Piltopolis, in a central location on the arable crescent. Government and culture (such as it is) are concentrated on Piltopolis, as is, to a certain extent, business. Most business is local, though; Piltonians can be very regional about which coast they live on or even which district they reside in. There is not much travel on-planet; there is almost no travel off-planet, except for business and trade, and the occasional delegation to Earth for governmental reasons.</p><p>Pilton is like any other of a hundred minor colony worlds in the Federation. The centralized government and its Starfleet have no interest in micromanaging or even meddling in the business of such an unimportant body politic. Strategically, however, Pilton has recently become a major dot on military maps. It occupies a forward position on the Federation-Flarn border, serving as the UFP's -- and thus Fleet Two's -- furthest outpost toward the Flarn interior. The Flarn Regime is an alien empire abutting Fleet Two's patrol zone, with whom the Federation has had a brief but rocky past.</p><p>The Federation has two bases in the Pilton area: P-Base (a slang name) is a top-secret installation on Pilton itself, within the inland desert, which was the subject of the recent Piltonian Insurrection. Outpost 45, newly constructed in stationary Pilton orbit, was built to serve as a refueling, refit, and command base for future Federation activities in this sector (i.e., possible campaigns of defense against Flarn aggression), and to keep an eye on the Flarn -- while at the same time letting them know that we're keeping an eye on them. Following its construction, which coincided with the Insurrection, it was given the auxiliary mission of keeping tabs on the revolutionary elements on the planet itself, and serving as a permanent Starfleet presence on a planet that has only two major Starfleet presences of note -- the top-secret base (the existence of which isn't even known to most people, and the true nature of which is shrouded from all) and a recruiting station.</p><p>"P-Base" is in fact an environmental research station. In 2365, it was set up by Starfleet as a location to test possible terraforming methods to convert Class Y planets into habitable environments. Because the chemical agents used are highly toxic and usable as chemical weapons, the station was placed on the then-backwoods Pilton colony and kept under tight security. Outside of the highest branches of the Pilton government, no one on the planet is aware of its purpose, and few are aware of its existence.</p><p>While Pilton as a planet isn't all that spectacular, nor are their people all that important in the galactic grand scheme of things, Pilton as a strategic base and bulwark against Flarn aggression is perhaps the Federation's best chance at getting a forewarning of Flarn attack and mustering a defense. The continued existence of Outpost 45 is of paramount importance to the security of this entire sector of the Alpha Quadrant.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="location-quanta"></a>Quanta</h2></div><div><h3 class="subtitle"><i>Quantas I</i></h3></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Jason</span> <span class="surname">Lee</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">19 April 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

The Quasians have calculated that these 32 moons will never crash into the planet or into each other so long as nothing happens to them. Quanta has an approximate diameter of 12,800 miles. The flora and fauna are primarily blue in color and vary in size. There are a few green planets, but they are rare to find. The planet has primarily good weather, however, there are a few bad storms occasionally. The Quasians have discovered an alien artifact which is lead to be the reason how the Quasians exist with 31 other selves and 31 other planets on different dimensional levels.</p><p>The Quasian government is an orderly and organized one, consisting of 32 representatives as a collective council for their planet. These 32 representatives are usually the 32 wisest and smartest people of all Quasians. This council is usually referred as the Quantar. Under the council, there are 32 committees that do various administrative tasks ordered by the council. These committees have 32 people each, and are either hired or voted by the people into office. In the event of an emergency or a disagreement, the 32 committees may meet, vote for one representative for each committee and form the Quasian Council of Agreement. The Quasian Council of Agreement is made of the 32 original representatives plus the 32 elected representatives of committees. The Council may include up to 32 elective representatives of the people, if the need arises. The Quasian Council requires 2/3 in agreement of all those present.</p><p>Quanta has many oceans, all which interconnect together. The Quasians have cities underwater due to the fact that the land mass of the planet is only about 32% of the planet. There are many sea creatures, including a dolphin like creature which the Quasians refer as dophians.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e4302"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>The planet's enviroment has not been altered in anyway. The Quasians do not have a history of industrialization by using fire as a source of power. The Quasians never had an ozone layer type problem due the fact that they primarily use hydropower more. Many of the Quasians' battles have occurred on or under water since the Quasians valued the parts of land that was available. However, the Quasians have learned many useful water technology which also made the land underwater just as valuable as the land above water. As a result, most of the battles on Quanta have occurred on Quanta's oceans.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="location-quantas"></a>Quantas</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Jason</span> <span class="surname">Lee</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">19 April 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

These planets exist but can not be visited in any normal means. They exist the same circular orbit of the only visible planet. These other 31 planets rotate around the star in different angles and in different direction. However every 10 Quanta (see Quasians for more information), all 31 planets become aligned and exist in the same space in space-time. During this time, the Quasians celebrate what they call the "Great Alignment." It is during this one full Quasian day that the Quasians are able to perform their best because they are in closest contact with their otherselves. The Great Alignment is one of the most productive days in all of Quasian history... simply because the majority of discoveries are discovered during the Great Alignment. The planets do not meet together on the same dimensional plane, but since they are in the same place in space-time, the Quasians are able to communicate with their other 31 selves faster than any other Quasian day. All other 31 planets mirror the existance of the visible planet except with minor differences. Quantas is medium size star, perhaps slightly larger than Earth's Sol. The temperature on Quantas is predicted to be about 1/3 greater than Sol. This star is very old, but it does not seem like it will change, die, or grow for another 20,000 Quanta.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e4366"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>It is lead to believe by neighbor races of the Quasians that this star's uniqueness comes from a possible reaction from an advanced alien race which caused some type of accident. This accident lead the destruction of the other planets in the particular system and resulted multiple dimensional copies of the remaining planet. This would explain the various asteriod belts near the system.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="location-qonos"></a>Qo'noS</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Emma</span> <span class="surname">Rouse-Deane</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">16 October 2001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

From space it is seen as a large green world. It consists of a large landmass which is dominated by a vast ocean. Qo'noS tilts on it's axis, which gives a range of climates and temperatures, and gives rise to extremes of both hot and freezing weather. Like earth it is a few degrees cooler at the poles. The Capital of Qo'noS is First City, where the Great Hall is located. This is a ceremonial building, which dominates the skyline. The Great Hall functions both as a parliament, and as a supreme court. It is the seat of Klingon Government. It's architecture reflects the Empire's military style, and the structures give the appearance of enormous fortresses.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e4448"></a>Places of Interest</h3></div></div></div><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td>A mountain on Qo'noS where legend tells that Kahless the Unforgettable forged the first bat'leth by dropping a lock of his hair into the lava.</td></tr><tr><td>A lake on Qo'noS.

In 2293, Qo'noS suffered severe environmental damage when Praxis, their key energy producing facility at the time suffered a catastrophic explosion that ended up shattering the moon, leaving only a small fragment behind. It was estimated that Qo'noS would have used up all of it's oxygen within 50 years, if resources were not spent into rectifying the problem. The Klingon Empire needed to reroute it's financial spending, and could no longer afford it's military campaign with the Federation. It was this key event that led to the peace initiative that was undertaken by Gorkon, then Chancellor of the Empire.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="location-risa"></a>Risa</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Jason</span> <span class="surname">Lee</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">25 March 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

In addition, Risa is renowned for its uninhibited sexuality another reason why millions of guests come to Risa. Risian sexuality is very much part of their culture. Identified by a decorative emblem on their foreheads between the eyes, Risians often initiate or respond to the desire for sexual relations through the use of a small statuette called a Horga'hn, the Risian symbol of sexuality. Display of a Horga'hn announces that the owner wishes to participate in jamaharon, a Risian sexual rite.</p><p>Risa orbits a multiple stars and is in the same sector as Starbase 12. Risa benefits from the most elaborate weather control system in the Federation despite the fact that it is a rain-soaked and geologically unstable jungle in its natural state. In addition, Risa seems to be hosts to many conferences in the Federation. It lies at least 6 hours in a Runabout from station Deep Space 9. It is interesting to note that the Risian computer has information on all the guests on Risa, and can tell one if someone has made arrangements for arrival.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e4547"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>Risa has been the focal point for the fate of superweapon Tox Uthat stolen from the future in 2366. Picard and a woman named Vash who proclaimed to be an assistant to an archeologist who spent many years in searching for the Tox Uthat. Vash apparently already discovered the Tox Uthat and hid it from a Ferengi named Sovak. Vash used Sovak in order to gain passage to Risa since she didn't have any funds to take her to Risa. Picard figured out that Vash had already discovered the Tox Uthat and contacted the Enterprise to do a level 14 transport on his order. When the Vorgons, a group of aliens claiming to be a security team, tried to take it from Picard; Picard ordered the transport which destroyed the Tox Uthat. It is presumed that the Vorgons have returned to the past in order to stop Picard.</p><p>Risa has been part of the abortive Ktairain Expansion plot using an addictive mental game in 2368. Lastly, it played to a series of protests by the reactionary New Essentialists movement in 2373.

Intelligence also believes a large underground black market may exist in the bowels of New Las Vegas.</p></div></div></div><div class="part" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="powers"></a>Powers</h1></div><div><h2 class="subtitle">Collection of the various powers and influences.</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="article"><a href="#power-flarn">Flarn Regime</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4667">Abstract</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4714">Overview</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4727">History</a></span></dt></dl></dd><dt><span class="article"><a href="#power-kton">K'Ton</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4765">Abstract</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4812">Overview</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4819">History</a></span></dt></dl></dd></dl></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="power-flarn"></a>Flarn Regime</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Larry</span> <span class="surname">Garfield</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">12 April 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

It consists of a single planet, the Flarn homeworld of Flick, along with several small military and mining garrison colonies. It is located in the Alpha Quadrant, several light-years from the Federation colony of Pilton.</p><p>The Flarn are technologically inferior to the Federation in almost every capacity, save military. The Flarn have devoted the vast majority of their history to the art of war, usually against each other, and as a result have developed highly advanced destructive machinery. As they are new to space exploration, their warp technology is considerably behind that of other major powers.</p><p>A Flarn Heavy Cruiser is about the size of a Constitution-class vessel, but shaped more like a bumpy wedge. It has dense ablative armor, reinforced adaptive shielding, plasma rockets, quantum torpedoes, multi-phasic disrupters, and antimatter countermeasures. It is unusually maneuverable for a ship its size. Its maximum speed is warp 3.1.</p><p>The most common Flarn vessel is the Flarn Streamer. Smaller and lighter than a Heavy Cruiser, it still possesses considerable firepower for its size. Plasma rockets, photon torpedoes, and multiple disruptor banks provide offensive power, while adaptive shielding protects the vessel itself. It has a maximum observed velocity of warp 2.4.</p><p>The Flarn currently lack transporter and replicator technology. All Starfleet vessels are instructed to obey the Prime Directive religiously in order to keep it that way.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e4727"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>When the Flarn race was finally unified under a single military leadership in 2343, they had only just developed space travel. Having no further enemies at home, they quickly developed interstellar travel in the hopes of finding new territory to conquer. With ships operating at only slightly more than the speed of light, it took them a while to establish any meaningful presence outside of their own system.</p><p>First contact with the Flarn came in 2370, when a pair of Flarn scout ships attacked the Starfleet cruiser Debian. The Debian was easily able to outrun the attacking vessels, but only after suffering heavy damage. The Federation was mildly concerned about this new hostile race, but the Flarn leadership was ecstatic at the thought of someone else to conquer. After a series of brief skirmishes with a task force led by the Nimitz-class USS Arleigh Burke and Trafalgar-class USS Lexington, however, the Flarn realized that assaulting the Federation would prove somewhat more difficult than they originally expected, and they decided to further entrench themselves within their own small territory before making an outright assault.</p><p>In 2373, the Federation decided to better protect itself against this new aggressor. The nearest Federation colony was the outlying world of Pilton, populated by strongly independent colonists, mostly human. Starfleet decided to construct a new starbase in orbit to serve as a first line of defense against the Flarn, as well as a base of operations. The new Outpost 45 would complement the center of Fleet Two operations, Starbase 93. Many on Pilton were not wild about the idea, however, as they valued their independence from the Federation proper.</p><p>The Flarn learned of the growing tension between Pilton and the Federation, and sought to exploit it, to sabotage the construction effort. In 2374, they secretly contacted Pilton-based Yankovic Heavy Industries and attempted to bribe them into helping sabotage the Pilton-Federation relationship. Yankovic's executives agreed, and the plan went forward, but was thwarted by Starfleet in 2375, just as construction on Outpost 45 was completed. The USS Arleigh Burke was destroyed in the process, and the vessel's surviving command staff and crew were transferred to the station to take command. The Flarn have been relatively quiet since the Piltonian Insurrection.</p><p>For more information on the Flarn, contact the author.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="power-kton"></a>K'Ton</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Philip</span> <span class="surname">Stonness</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">21 March 2002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

This group works like the Maquis, they use stolen Romulan vessels to destroy Federation outposts, warning them to end the alliance. Most of their technolodgy is Romulan, but they have reported having Dominion style transporters. Their main targets are outposts and starbases along the Neutral Zone, except attacks from the K'ton have also been reported around Betazed, Pacifica, Risa, Disharn VII, and in one instance Mars Colony.</p><p>Their leader has been suspected to be a retired Romulan Admiral, G'rol, except no proof of his implications have been found thus far. The Romulan Government assures the Federation that everything in their power is being done to stop these terrorists, except many Star-Fleet officials think they are secretly aiding the K'ton in their fight. There have also been romours of several K'ton infiltrators in Star-Fleet. One of these spys have been confirmed, however the suposed Admiral T'grek transported away from Earth before he could be apprehended on Stardate 01021.2</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e4819"></a>History</h2></div></div></div><p>Even though these terrorists have not been around for long, they have created much disturbance. Shortly after the Dominion War, all diplomats attending a peace conference between the Romulan Empire and the Federation were killed in a bombing. Ever since that inncident, the Federation have dispatched ships to seek out and capture all suspected K'ton vessels. So far however, it is estimated only 12% of all their resources in total have been confiscated. On Stardate 00122.3 Star-Fleet intercepted a K'ton transmission from Risa to Pacifica. Using help from Vulcan mathimaticians, Star-Fleet found the transmission was holding information about a K'ton attack on Nimbus III. Two monthes after, the U.S.S. Trinitron was ordered to avert this attack and capture these Romulan attackers.</p></div></div></div><div class="part" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="misc"></a>Miscellaneous</h1></div><div><h2 class="subtitle">Various and sundry other items of interest</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="article"><a href="#misc-planetclassification">Planetary Classification</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4867">Overview</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4870">Zones</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4886">Planetary Evolution</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4898">M sub-types</a></span></dt></dl></dd><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4905">Planetary Classes</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4908">Class A - Geothermal</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e4960">Class B - Geomorteus</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5012">Class C - Ceoinactive</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5064">Class D - Asteroid/Moon</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5116">Class E - Geoplastic</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5168">Class F Geometallic</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5220">Class G - GeoCrystalline</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5272">Class H - Desert</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5324">Class I - Gas Supergiant</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5376">Class J - Gas Giant</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5428">Class K - Adaptable </a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5480">Class L - Marginal</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5532">Class M - Terrestrial (Minshara)</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5584">Class N - Reducing</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5636">Class O - Pelagic (M subtype)</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5688">Class P - Glaciated (M subtype)</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5740">Class Q - Variable</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5792">Class R - Rouge</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5844">Class S - Ultra-giant</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5896">Class T - Mega-giant</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e5948">Class Y - Demon</a></span></dt></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><span class="article"><a href="#misc-starclassification">Stellar Classification</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#d0e6034">Stellar Classes</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d0e6037">Class O</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d0e6065">Class B</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d0e6093">Class A</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d0e6121">Class F</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d0e6149">Class G</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d0e6177">Class K</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d0e6205">Class M</a></span></dt></dl></dd><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#d0e6233">Stellar Class Subdivisions</a></span></dt></dl></dd></dl></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="misc-planetclassification"></a>Planetary Classification</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Patrick</span> <span class="surname">Greenwell</span></h3></div><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Randy</span> <span class="surname">McCullick</span></h3></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">9 Jaunary 2004</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

They are an original Trek-inspired part of the STF universe that do not appear in canon Trek or in a Trek novel.  These often show up in STF, so they are useful to have clearly referenced.  Examples include the Crag, Flarn, New Bajor, and so forth.</p><p>Custom entries are, strictly speaking, "owned" by the STF member who developed them.  The STF Reference Manual is hosting them for reference by the rest of STF so that others know what "Trek+" settings they may run into.  The definitive source for a Custom entry is the original author(s) and the approved entry.  Custom entries should be restricted to Custom information only, and not be an "extension" on any particular canon or non-canon subject.</p><p>A Custom entry may be updated only by the original author/submitter, or the original author/submitter and someone else he chooses to bring on board.  The author/submitter may bestow ownership of the entry on another member, removing himself, by explicitly notifying the GMDir and Librarian by email and posting in the GMD ship to that effect.</p></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="reference-template-power"></a>Power Template</h2></div></div><hr></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d0e6306">Power Template</a></span></dt></dl></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e6306"></a>Power Template</h2></div></div></div><p>Entries for a Power should appear as follows when posted:</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>

There is no exam to take, or grade to worry about. This course simply goes through the functions of the administrative menu one by one, examining them in detail.</p><p>Now, if you look below the ship's roster, you will find a mysterious new button, let's find out what it does.

Although MOTD stands for Message of the Day, these pages don't have to be updated that often. They should, however, be updated regularly. MOTDs with outdated information are of no use to anyone.</p><p>When you access the MOTD, you're presented with the text version, including all the HTML codes. If you're not familiar with HTML, the Internet Department can help you out. Your best bet in the mean time is to keep the current MOTD design and simply alter the contents.</p><p>To do that, simply find the area you want to change, highlight the text, and then rewrite the section. When you're done, cross your fingers and hit Write the new MOTD button.</p><p>Return to the MOTD and make sure the changes you made look okay. Even HTML experts can create typos which wreak havoc with the code. If something looks wrong, be sure to go back to the editor and correct it.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e6505"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Write the new MOTD</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="textbook/textbook/images/textbook/modify-motd.png" alt="Write the new MOTD"></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="admin-103"></a>The Captain's Log</h2></div></div></div><p>The Captain's log is accessible by anyone as soon as they log into Star-Fleet. It should be a transcript of what has been going on in the ship. It's usually written in character, although that's not a rule. It should also be updated regularly. Not all captain's use the log option. If you do, keep it current.</p><p>Once you access the log, you'll see what is currently in the file. You can delete what's there, but it's customary to leave a few of the old logs in there, as a sort of running commentary on what's happening on the ship.</p><p>Here's an example, taken from the USS Challenger. (At the time of this writing, Scott Jones was CO, Deanne Ashton XO, and Sinead Doyle GM):</p><p>Captain's log: Supplemental; Upon reaching the surface our party found the main base to be abandoned, at least a week I'm told. We've made contact with 2 members of the observation team, one of them was wounded by an arrow. I'm going to get as many of the observation team off planet as soon as able. Apparently Dr. Holland has had an accident and believes himself to be the character he was roleplaying, now he's helping the local king hunt down the rest of the observation team who have been labeled witches. I don't plan to leave Dr Holland behind, but if I have to choose between him and my ship, I choose my ship.</p><p>Captain's Log Stardate 01121.2 We've arrived at Aibrean, plagued by little malfunctions that are appearing all over the ship. My CE is keeping these under control, but we've had no idea who's doing it. Also, a Cadet was found murdered, cause of death reportedly a phaser set on stun at close range, quite fatal. I've set the away team and we are heading planetside to get the anthropology team out of there. I've left Commander Tanan in command of Challenger, since I'm leading the away team. I'm pretty sure I'm the only one with any field combat experience, if things get hairy, it could get ugly, very fast. The ion storm is arriving sooner than expected, so instead of having days to get the team out, we've only got hours.</p><p>Captain's Log Stardate 01112.8 Captain Boka recording: We've been ordered to the planet Aibrean, located in the Neutral Zone, to pick up an anthropology team that's studying the natives there. Admiral Cagney has informed us that the Roms are aware of our mission, so we shouldnt expect any hostilities from them. Personally, i'm expecting some trouble, frankly, I don't trust Roms further than I can throw them. But we need to get in and out as quickly as possible, since in 7 days an ion storm will hit the planet, and these last for a very long time, i'm told. The transit will take 3 days, maximum warp. In addition to this, Starfleet has saddled us with Admiral Cagney, who's along for the ride, but turns out to be an old friend of the leader of the previously mentioned anthropology team. We've recently left starbase at warp but now we are traveling at sublight, due to what appears to be a malfunction. My CE assures me that everything was working when we left the base, but he's checking it out, just in case.</p><p>Captain's Log, Stardate 01110.8, Captain Boka Jakob recording I've just assumed command of Challenger, seeking my first officer. Will have to schedule a meet and greet with all DH's. Current ship's status, unknown. But on a personal note, she looks like a fine vessel.</p><p>Now you have an idea of how the Captain's log works, we'll move on to adding characters.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="admin-104"></a>Adding A Character</h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="d0e6542"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Add a new Character Page</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="textbook/textbook/images/textbook/add-character.png" alt="Add a new Character Page"></div></div><p>When you start adding a new character, choose the owner from the drop down menu. Then write in the character name. Pick the character's position from the drop down menu. Department heads are chiefs, so the CMO would be Medical Chief and COS would be Security Chief. Junior officers are assistants. If you're creating a custom position, tick the override box and type in the position title. For example: Bartender, Xenobiologist, Archeologist. Select the appropriate rank, and press the Write User to Disk button to save your changes. If you make a mistake, press the Reset button, and start again.</p><p>Of note: Only players with FComm access or above have access to the ranks above Commander. Also, the Crewman rank is not available in the Create Character mode (for reasons unclear to this writer). If you have an enlisted character, create it as a Civilian, then use the Modify Character option (explained in the next lesson) to change it to Crewman.</p><p>Giving a rank puts the character on the roster. If you do not want the character on the roster (ie: GM characters for each sim are kept off the roster), leave the rank area with No Title. If the character has a rank, put it with the name. (ie: Admiral John Doe rather than just John Doe.)</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="admin-105"></a>Modifying a Character</h2></div></div></div><p>As the name implies, you use this option to make changes to an existing character. Name changes, promotions, demotions, and department switches are handled here. Plus the switch to Crewman, as mentioned in the previous lesson. If you need to AWOL a player, you change the rank to AWOL. More on the AWOL process is found in Lesson 108.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e6568"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Modify an existing Character Page</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="textbook/textbook/images/textbook/modify-character.png" alt="Modify an existing Character Page"></div></div><p>Select the character you wish to modify from the drop down menu and fill in the fields that you wish to change, as described in lesson 104.</p><p>You'll notice the (spoooooooned) part in the example. This is the WeBB's way of acknowledging a custom position. If you make ANY changes to a custom position, be sure to tick the override box. Otherwise, the entry will get scrambled.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Always go to the main Admin menu after you finish one change if you intend to do another one. After modifying a character, the drop down list order can change, which will not be seen if you just clicked the back button to get to the previous page.</em></span></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="admin-106"></a>Deleting a Character</h2></div></div></div><p>When you have no further use for a character, either because the player or character is gone, it is customary to delete it from the ship. Just removing a character from the roster does not take it off the ship. If the player has left the ship, but the character is just off the roster, it creates inaccurate information in the player's posting record. So be sure to actually delete the character from the ship database.</p><p>Note: Only the CO and XO should delete characters belonging to a player. The GM has jurisdiction only over the characters he created for his sim.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e6597"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Delete an existing Character Page</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="textbook/textbook/images/textbook/delete-character.png" alt="Delete an existing Character Page"></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Always go to the main Admin menu before deleting another character. After a deleting a character, the drop down charcter list order can change, which will not be seen if you just clicked the back button to get to the previous page.</em></span></p><p>Now, onto the last three things on your menu: the topic managing facilities.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="admin-107"></a>Topic Facilities</h2></div></div></div><p>The last things you need to know about are the topic facilities. These control who can add a topic, how long a topic will stay on the ship, deleting a topic, and changing a topic.</p><p>Turning the topic restrictions on or off is for COs only. If restrictions are on, it stops the general crewmembers from adding their own topics, and allows only the CO, XO and GM to add topics. Only the CO should change the topic restrictions. If the restrictions are off, anyone can add a topic.</p><p>Removing a topic can help keep the ship's topic list from becoming too cluttered. The problem here is you can only delete topics that contain no notes. So you have to wait until post archives are downloaded and a topic is empty before you can delete it.</p><p>Alternatively, a CO, XO, and GM may prefer just to rename the unneeded topics rather than deleting one and adding another. This is very useful if an archive has not been run, because topics do not need to be empty to be changed. The only downside is it makes navigating the archives a bit difficult.</p><p>A topic's 'immortality' refers to how long it will stay on the ship. When an archive purge is run, all topics on a ship which are empty are removed automatically. Some topics, such as the Bridge, should be made permanent (perm) as they are inherent to the ship. All topics denoted as (perm) will not be purged. All topics denoted (norm) are subject to purging if they are empty. This is for CO use only.</p><p>That covers all the functions of the Admin Menu. However, there are a couple of other administrative duties that deserve to be examined a little closer. We'll do that in the next lesson.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="admin-108"></a>AWOLs and LOAs</h2></div></div></div><p>When crewmembers take LOAs, it is their duty to inform their CO or XO and to declare their LOA using the "Declare an LOA" function of the WeBB. Players doing this will update their status on the rosters (the new column you now see). Some COs also append it to the players character name or one of the other editable fields so that the rest of the crew without a view of the Status column can see that a person is on LOA. The status column will also give you an indication of how active a person is. You can tell if a person is AWOL as you can see the number of days since their last post on the ship. This number is rounded down, (e.g. If a person has not posted for 1 day, 23 hours, 59 minutes, the number shown will be a 1).</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e6637"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Example Roster</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="textbook/textbook/images/textbook/roster.png" alt="Example Roster"></div></div><p>The status column, is the one that is to the right of everyone's real name. Now, in a perfect world these should all read 0. As mentioned above, these numbers are the number of whole days since the crewmember last posted. When the number gets into the double digits (somewhere around 14 days) this number changes to show the number of days since the players last login. If you click on this number, you will see some summary information about the players login, and a list of all the players ships. The number shown next to these ships is the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds since they last posted on them. This number does not change to the login number like the previous one does. This can be useful if you're wondering if it's just your ship the person has stopped posting on, or whether they have slowed down in general.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e6654"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Example Player Stats</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="textbook/textbook/images/textbook/player-statistics.png" alt="Example Player Stats"></div></div><p>When a player uses the "Declare an LOA" button at the bottom of the main Page after logging in, then LOA will be seen in the status column for that player. If you then click the status to go to the breakdown page, it will give you the reason they put in for the LOA, and the time left until they due to return.</p><p>If a character is past the AWOL limit set for the fleet, then as CO or the person assigned to carry out the admin of the roster, you can modify that persons character rank to AWOL using the Modify Character button of the Admin Menu (usage of this button can be found in Lesson 105. Just as an aside, it's nice to e-mail them and follow it up before you just AWOL or delete characters from the roster.</p><p>We have now gone through the basic use of the "Administrative" menu. Just the Conclusion to go and you've finished this course.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="admin-conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div></div><p>We have been through all the different options of the Admin Menu, and I hope I have been helpful. I have not included much about the confirmation pages you see after you have modified something. They usually just give you a link back to the Admin menu anyway.</p><p>Make sure you always read the MOTD after you make changes, just to check that you haven't left any stray HTML tags or crewmembers lying around.</p><p>The main thing to keep in mind when using the Admin menu is don't use the back button unless you can help it - the WeBB doesn't like it. If you make a mistake, just go back and redo it, that's what the reset buttons are for. No one will persecute you for making a few mistakes at first, you're only human after all. Never be afraid to ask for help.</p><p>Lastly, good luck with your new position, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact the commandant using the e-mail address to the left.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>My thanks have to go to the following people for their help in the development of the course, and for reading the (several) drafts of it and not laughing to hard.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Amanda Noon</p></li><li><p>Emma Rouse-Deane</p></li><li><p>Nikolle Burchett</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="textbook-counseling"></a>Counseling</h2></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="firstname">Deanne</span> <span class="surname">Ashton</span></h3><code class="email">&lt;<a href="mailto:"></a>&gt;</code></div></div></div><div><div class="revhistory"><table border="1" width="100%" summary="Revision history"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><b>Revision History</b></th></tr><tr><td align="left">Revision 1</td><td align="left">19 September 2005</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">

Welcome to the Academy's Counselor class. I am your instructor Jack Dipper.</p><p>Over the course of the next five lessons, I'll be teaching you some of the nuances of being a ship's counselor, like how to walk that fine line between helpful crew mate and nosey neighbor. So, without further adieu, let's begin:</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="cns-101"></a>The Basics</h2></div></div></div><p>Being a ship's counselor does not make one strictly the resident shrink. It is an important position that helps keep everyone, from the captain down to the lowest enlisted man, doing his best for the ship and crew. Duties include counseling individual crewmen; providing periodic performance reports for each crew member; and offering advice on command decisions. Additionally, counselors are also unofficial morale officers, striving to provide ways to keep the mood up on the starship or space station. Morale boosting is a vital duty for counselors serving aboard more battle-prone star ships, such as the Fifth Fleet USS Andorian.</p><p>Who makes a good counselor? Anyone with a desire to closely interact with other personnel and who has the ability to make objective evaluations of a given situation. Personal prejudices have no place in a counselor.</p><p>Does a counselor have to be empathic or telepathic? No. Although Commander Deanna Troi of the USS Enterprise, an empathic half-Betazoid, has made an indelible impression on the corps of counselors following in her footsteps, one must realize that her skill as a psychologist was not based solely on her ability to read emotions. Indeed, counselors who are empathic and/or telepathic have a more difficult path to follow.</p><p>For instance, an empathic counselor is in the recreation area just as a young man walks in who just broke up with his girlfriend. The man is angry, hurt, and possibly feeling worthless. The counselor picks up on this, but must be able to decide if intervention is required. In most cases, it is not. These feelings are typical and natural reactions to a sudden termination of a relationship. A counselor who queries every crewman about every extrasensory perception the counselor intercepts borders on harassment, and is of value to no one. Additionally, just knowing what the person is feeling isn't enough. A counselor must then know how to deal with these feelings.</p><p>So while a counselor with extrasensory perceptions may seem to have a leg up on one who does not, it is not so. The quality of the counselor depends on the counselor's training and dedication to his or her position.</p><p>And nothing less than a quality counselor is adequate for any ship in the Fleet.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="cns-102"></a>Counseling on the Bridge</h2></div></div></div><p>Nowhere is a counselor more visible, nor more influential, than while on bridge duty. Therefore, it is here that the portrayer must pay special attention to character work. Actions taken here can have far reaching consequences. A bad piece of advice or a flare of temper can destroy a counselor character's credibility instantaneously.</p><p>While on the bridge, the counselor's duty is to gauge the emotional condition of the command staff and provide the captain with insight and advice regarding command decisions. It is not the counselor's job to question every order the captain gives, but rather, to offer an alternative perspective if it is required.</p><p>Should the captain give an order that could be counterproductive to the mission, is fueled by personal concerns, or unnecessarily risk the safety of the ship and/or crew, it is the counselor's responsibility to discuss it with the captain.</p><p>Ideally, the counselor will talk with the captain privately. However, some situations require immediate action. In these rare instances, the counselor should be careful to be discreet, respectful, and non-confrontational when offering the captain the alternative advice.</p><p>Remember, as a counselor it is your duty to provide the captain with options. It is not the captain's duty, however, to abide by them.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="cns-103"></a>Individual Counseling</h2></div></div></div><p>As any counseling character soon discovers, you don't get many patients at your door. Few people are willing to subject their characters to the type of flaw required to need counseling.</p><p>Therefore, it's a common tendency to try and find patients. This is rarely a good idea. Pouncing on every crewman who seems to be having a bad day borders on harassment. If others resent your character being a busy body, you've reduced your chances even further of having any significant interaction with them.</p><p>However, by simply paying attention to the happenings aboard ship, a person playing a counselor will find plenty of opportunities to get involved without cornering their crewmates. It is a matter of recognizing where counselor intervention is required.</p><p>The death of a crewman or a member of his family deserves counselor attention; usually in the form of a sympathetic ear for the bereaved. A counselor is also a logical contributor to any interrogation process to provide insight into body language and motivations. Likewise, a counselor should be included on diplomatic missions or other cultural exchanges. Characters who attempt suicide or exhibit other extreme irrational and/or dangerous behavior, require serious psychological attention. And it is in these cases that the counselor is both expected and required to force interaction.</p><p>Common sense on the part of the player is necessary in handling any counseling situation. Remember, a counselor should be viewed as an asset to the crew, not an annoyance.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="cns-104"></a>Little Known Responsibilities</h2></div></div></div><p>A component of counseling often overlooked is the role of morale officer. A necessary post on all long-range and/or battle-oriented cruiser, the role can also be vital to any ship that experiences high levels of stress.</p><p>Put simply, as morale officer, it is the counselor's duty to keep the crew relaxed. This is achieved through various diversions, such as concerts, classes, plays, and sports tournaments. Interestingly, these diversions are as enjoyable for the role-player as they are for the characters. It provides a break from RPG-related role-playing and offers a different level of character interaction. This change can act as a breath of fresh air; giving new life to the ship.</p><p>However, just because it's a good thing does not mean it should be overused. Diversions should be introduced sparingly and when the RPG can logically support the endeavor.</p><p>Another duty of counselor is to assist the executive officer with annual reviews. This duty requires attention to detail on the part of the role-player, as it requires genuine knowledge of the crew's player characters and their lives. It also requires a counselor role-player to separate his personal feelings toward another role-player. Allowing real-life prejudices to taint a character review only causes rifts to deepen and the integrity of the counseling character to deteriorate.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="cns-105"></a>Psychology in Space</h2></div></div></div><p>The populace of STF space is as varied as the stars themselves. And every character species has its own unique psychology. It is up to the counseling role-player to use common sense when dealing with species-related idiosyncrasies.</p><p>For instance, Klingons are inherently aggressive. A Klingon officer who yells at his department head is a job for his commanding officer, not the counselor. A Klingon department head who constantly berates his staff, however, creates a morale problem and does require counselor attention. Determining how to handle any given situation requires common sense and thought on the part of the role-player.</p><p>And, as varied as the counselor's crew is the counselor character pool. Role-players need to take into consideration the pros and cons of playing non - human counselors. The temptation of abusing a species' telepathic and/or empathic skills is often one hard to conquer. But remember, for every character plus, there must be a minus. A telepathic character, for instance, is restricted by ethical concerns over reading thoughts and acting upon them.</p><p>Someone who refuses to allow the negatives in with his character's positives, is creating an all-powerful character that will not earn him respect, but rather contempt from his crewmen; ruining the RPG experience for everyone.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="cns-conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div></div><p>The role of counselor is a varied and interesting one. But it requires a different level of dedication from the role-player. Not only does it require a commonsense knowledge of psychology, but an ability to walk a fine ethical line in role-playing.</p><p>A counselor strives to keep the crew balanced by providing an alternative perspective and unbiased advice. Superheroes need not apply. But those who feel they can handle the burden on their shoulders will find themselves having a wonderful time.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="cns-exam"></a>Exam</h2></div></div></div><p>Submission Instructions</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Write out your answers to the questions below.</p></li><li><p>E-mail them to the course grader: <a href="mailto:jb.dipper.stf@gmail.com" target="_top">Jack Dipper</a></p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Be sure to include your full name at the top of the e-mail!</em></span></p></li><li><p>Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send the original question, just the answers.</p></li><li><p>Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send your answers as an attachment.

Your professor will be Admiral Larry Garfield. Larry has been a member of STF since 22 August 1997 and has served in a variety of capacities.  His Engineering work includes co-designer of the Trafalgar, McCoy, and Viking-class specs as well as sole designer of the Yub nub class.  He has served as Engineering Director, Asssitant Engineering Director, Engineering Assistant, and Dockmaster, and has authored or co-authored numerous Engineering Department policies.  Now that I'm done tooting my own horn, on to the course.</p><p>Over the course of the lessons that follow we will be covering one major topic: Real Physics and Star Trek Physics. That is, we will be covering two major topics: Real Physics, Star Trek Physics, and How to Role Play in Engineering. We WILL be covering three major topics: Real Physics, Star Trek Physics, How to Role Play in Engineering, and Starship Design. Amongst the topics that we will be covering are such diverse subjects as...</p><p>Anyway, we'll be doing a lot. This class is intended to make you a better RPer as well as a better member of the ED. It will, hopefully, also inform you about matters of physics, real and Paramount, that you never knew and probably never wanted to. Be warned, however, that the pages that follow may contain graphic material, and are not recommended for people who are faint of heart or bandwidth.</p><p>So on to the course already!</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="eng-101"></a>The real world</h2></div></div></div><p>One thing that sets Star Trek aside from most other Sci-Fi shows is that almost all of its scientific "techno-babble," the fancy words they throw around to make the warp core sound like something you want for Christmas, is based on real world physics or what we think is real world physics. While shows like Babylon 5 may have more realistic space movement for conventional thrusters, Star Trek delves into the world of quantum physics and relativity and does so accurately, most of the time. Therefore, to understand Star Trek Physics we must first comprehend what is already known about the universe. It is assumed that you are already familiar with Newtonian Physics, as going into that would take too much time.</p><p>All matter is made up of atoms. All atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. All protons and neutrons are made up of a special combination of quarks (pronounced "quorks" to rhyme with cork, not with a certain bartender who shall remain nameless). At this point scientists begin to disagree. Some say quarks are the most fundamental building block of the universe. The latest neat theory, known as "M-Theory" is that all matter can be broken down into flat sheets that have dimensions of zero by zero by zero. The most commonly accepted theory, at least this week, is that all matter can be broken down into "superstrings," particles that have dimensions zero by zero by zero and are shaped like a piece of spaghetti. If the logic of a piece of spaghetti with no dimensions doesn't seem quite Vulcan in its soundness, don't worry. It's actually a mathematical representation of something people who don't hold advanced degrees can't possibly hope to understand without a decent helping of tomato sauce. But whichever theory is correct, they all state the same thing: these fundamental building blocks are made up of energy, and all interaction between particles, which are now simply an illusion created by energy, occurs through what are known as mediator particles.</p><p>Now that you are totally confused, let's discuss those mediator particles. There are four fundamental forces in the Universe: Gravity, Electromagnetism, the Strong Nuclear Force, and the Weak Nuclear Force. While it is often convenient and easier to think of these forces simply happening, through a simple mathematical equation like F=m*a, that is not completely accurate. All interaction between particles is mediated by special particles that are even smaller. The most famous of these is the still-theoretical graviton. Gravitons, like all other mediator particles, do their thing by exchanging places with other gravitons. If a proton and neutron are close enough to each other, then one graviton from the proton will go flying off towards the neutron and vice versa. In doing so, a force is exerted, a force we know as gravity. The closer the two particles, the faster the gravitons are exchanged and the stronger the force. Of course, while it is a nice theory, modern scientists are still scratching their heads when it comes to finding one outside of a calculator (or supercomputer, as the case may be), but it seems to make sense on printer paper.</p><p>Electromagnetism, or EM, exists in the form of radiation. That radiation is a wave of photons, and like any wave has a velocity, a wavelength, and a frequency. The velocity is determined solely by the medium through which the wave is traveling. The wavelength and frequency then inversely related in the equation wavelength*frequency=velocity. The wavelength of the wave determines what the radiation is. Very low wavelength EM radiation is known as radio, and carries such interesting information as accidents on the highway, the latest music by the rock artist who's popular this week, and the latest news on how the government is corrupt and every politician is blaming everyone else except himself. At the other end of the EM spectrum is the extremely short-wavelength of gamma radiation and X-rays. Somewhere in the middle resides visible light, in a very small range. Human eyes are only capable of picking out this small region because our eyes evolved that way, whereas other species can see different ranges of EM radiation, such as ultraviolet. Geordi LaForge's VISOR allowed him to see the entire spectrum at once, which is why everyone else said it was amazing and he said it gave him a headache.</p><p>If you are still reading this, congratulations. You are officially a dedicated, devoted, honest-to-goodness fanatic. Fear not, the easy stuff is coming up next, so that only you devoted few will get it.</p><p>All particles in the universe have a charge. For some particles, that charge is zero. A good example of this is the neutrino, one of the three building blocks of a neutron. (I'll bet you didn't know that a neutron is really just an electron, a proton, and a neutrino stuck very closely together, did you?) And for every particle there is an anti-particle, identical in absolutely every possible way except for the charge. An electron has a mass of 9.1x10<sup>-28</sup> grams and a charge of -1. An anti-electron has a mass of 9.1x10<sup>-28</sup> grams and a charge of +1. It is more commonly known as a "positron." (Not to be confused with Data's "positronic net" neurology. That is something else entirely.) In theory, you can build entire atoms, molecules, and even entire galaxies out of anti-matter. There's just one teeny tiny problem. If a particle comes into contact with its anti-particle, they destroy each other in a really cool light show that produces an amount of energy equivalent to their mass, as described by that really neat equation that you really should know before you go any further, E=MC<sup>2</sup>, where E is energy in joules, M is mass in kilograms (combined mass of both matter and anti-matter), and C is the speed of light in meters per second. In the metric system, the speed of light is approximately 3x10<sup>8</sup> meters per second. But if you could find a way to safely manufacture or harvest anti-matter and then collect the energy created by destroying it, that would be even better than the still-to-be-invented cold fusion. More on this in the next class.</p><p>Easy right?</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="eng-102"></a>Paramount gets involved</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you have a basic grasp of modern-day cutting edge physics, so what? I mean, who cares about gravitons and anti-whatsits?</p><p>Apparently you do, or you wouldn't be reading this lecture. Now to put all that techno-babble into practice. Let's discuss some of the more interesting Star Trek technologies, and see how they make use of these fancy words.</p><p>Warp drive is the most interesting of all of Star Trek's technological wonders, and it is the most controversial. The basic principle behind it is quite simple. Remember the anti-matter we talked about in our last class? All Starfleet ships with a warp core carry with them fuel in the form of deuterium and anti-deuterium. "Deuterium" is an isotope of hydrogen, containing one proton and one electron, but also one neutron. Anti-deuterium, therefore, contains one anti-proton, one positron, and one anti-neutron. The anti-deuterium, usually just called anti-matter, is stored in magnetic containers, which use magnetic fields to keep the atoms moving in a circle without ever touching the walls of the container. These storage chambers are connected to one end of the Matter/Anti-Matter Reaction Assembly, or MARA. That's the blue tube with the flashing lights that you see in the middle of engineering on the Enterprise-D. At the other end of the MARA -- usually the top or front, depending on the orientation -- is the deuterium tank, which stores the deuterium in a really big metal tank, similar to the trucks you see on the highway only much bigger and stronger. Matter and anti-matter are both pumped into the MARA at both ends at exactly the same rate, and the stream is controlled by magnetic fields to guide the particles into the Reaction Chamber, that big round thing in main engineering. Inside the Reaction Chamber sits the dilithium crystal, a fictional invention of the producers. Dilithium is special because it's crystal structure is just the right size and shape to channel the flying particles of matter and anti-matter to hit each other head on. It is also the only material known to Federation science that does not interact with anti-matter. How? Good question. We don't have a good answer. When the matter and anti-matter hit each other, they cease to exist, and produce pure energy in the form of plasma. This plasma is then channeled out into the pink tubes you see behind the warp core to the Electro-Plasma System (EPS) and to the warp nacelles. It's here that the explanations differ.</p><p>In order to make life easier for future writers, and because they don't quite know how it works either, the producers of Star Trek have deliberately left the description of how this immense power can possibly make a ship go faster than the speed of light quite vague. According to the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual, published by the producers, it has something to do with a "subspace field" or "warp field" that managed to side-step the restrictions imposed by Einstein's Special Relativity. How? Pick an answer, none of them really work.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>One theory put forth by Professor Lawrence M. Krauss in his book The Physics of Star Trek is that a warp field somehow manages to create a huge gravity well in front of the ship and a gravity vacuum behind the ship. The ship and the space around it are then pulled forward. But as the ship moves forward, so does the gravity well, so the space around the ship and therefore the ship moves along with it, like hanging a carrot in front of a donkey. Since the ship is at rest relative to the space around it, there is no time dilation problem. And this method works perfectly and logically, according to modern physics and even Einsteinian Relativity. But only if you can produce enough energy to create such a gravity well, which would require several thousand times the energy produced in the entirety of human history, and several thousand times the energy of a matter/anti-matter reaction. Somewhere on the order of a black hole.</p></li><li><p>Another theory put forth by STF's very own Colin Wyers is that subspace is not another dimension but a thin film of zero-dimensional particles that is uniform throughout the universe, and exist for less than a billionth of a second, known as the Zero Point Field. According to him, a warp field causes the ZPF particles in front of the ship to be moved to the back, creating a vacuum in the ZPF in front of the ship, and the ship is sucked in to fill the vacuum. The problem here? Several Star Trek episodes have established that subspace is not a field of particles but another domain, one in which other species can even exist. There's also the problem of moving a particle that exists for only a billionth of a second.</p></li><li><p>STF's Randy McCullick has suggested yet another brand of warp drive, in which subspace is somewhat akin to the hyperspace used by most other shows, such as Star Wars and Babylon 5. He argues that a warp field is a "pocket" of this subspace/hyperspace which allows the ship to break all kinds of fun rules. This theory is the closest to what we have seen on the show, yet is the farthest from what the official publications tell us happens. As a side note, both McCullick's Wave Motion Engine and the failed Transwarp drive worked on the principle of putting the ship into subspace instead of subspace around the ship. The advantage was that if you traveled at a given speed in subspace it would take you 3 weeks ship time to get from point A to point B but that was only 4 days normal time. Of course, that meant the crew was significantly older than they should be.</p></li></ul></div><p>Which is correct? None of them. There is right now no convincing argument for any of the proposed methods. So until Stephen Hawking manages to figure out just how it all works, the safest thing we fans can do is nod our head and say "Yep, it works" and leave well enough alone.</p><p>The second major technology of Star Trek that gets people excited is transporters and their related technologies. In a nutshell, a personnel transporters work by first creating a virtual energy "tube" called an Anular Confinement Beam between the point of origin and the destination. Then, the transporter examines you, determines exactly how you are made up at that precise moment, and chops you down to the quark level. A fancy device called a Heisenburg compensator is used to keep track of the wave/particle duality that makes dealing with quarks so confusing. The individual quarks, along with instructions on how to put them back together again, are sent through the tube and the reassembled at the other end, and voila! Cargo transporters, on the other hand, only break matter down to the molecular level, so they are not able to handle biological material. Replicators do essentially the same thing, except they are stored at the molecular level and and can be held indefinitely. In fact, molecules are stored in the computer somewhere and then assembled one by one on demand to the recipe you call for, such as tomato soup, for which there are over thirty different recipes. Transporters are actually even less grounded in modern physics that warp drive. In fact, they are the least explained and least likely to ever occur. Within the last year, scientists have been able to essentially transport individual quarks, and even at atom at one point, but the same scientists still say that Star Trek-style transporters are not forthcoming, and probably won't be. But, this is Star Trek, and the magic wand has been woven. So, just as for warp, the safest thing to do is push the button and watch your away team disappear in some really nice special effects.</p><p>Remember those gravitons we talked about? Well guess what, they're useful too. Through still more unexplained means, starships are able to produce, or maybe collect we are never quite sure, free gravitons. Those gravitons are then held in a field surrounding the ship by more magic. When a phaser beam or torpedo hits the graviton field it is deflected by the gravimetric distortions. From one point of view, the object is suddenly moved elsewhere, usually around the shields and dissipating into space. Since all matter is really just energy, and all energy waves are really just a pattern of motion in particles (one of the universes many ways of giving college students a headache), this works for both phasers and disrupters as well as torpedoes, missiles, and the random asteroid or shuttle craft piloted by Starfleet officers masquerading as Maquis. Or not.</p><p>Confused yet? If not, then I guess I'm not doing my job. Digest this lesson for a while, and then go on to the next lesson. Maybe I can confuse you there.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="eng-103"></a>Now do it yourself</h2></div></div></div><p>We now come to the question of application. You now have -- or should, unless you've been reading these classes out of order in which case shame on you -- a working knowledge of how the Universe works according to modern scientists as well as the key ways in which Star Trek plays with them. Now, is that actually useful in STF? The answer is: Sort of.</p><p>The first thing to remember is that most STFers have NOT read this wonderful treatise on everything you ever wanted to know about physics but were afraid to ask. And unless you have an advanced degree yourself , chances are you are sitting there now with no idea how to apply all of this techno-babble in your daily RPing. (Or weekly for those of you in Fleet Two, or hourly for those on the Endevour.) Well guess what, that's not as big a problem as it seems.</p><p>There's a great deal of valid, relevant information not covered here, much of it more useful in your IC posting, in the TV shows themselves. And there's still more in the canon publications. More on those later.</p><p>So why are you still reading this? Here's why:</p><p>To role play in engineering takes 20% technical knowledge, 30% Star Trek technical knowledge, and 60% creativity. And being able to add is often useful. (Damnit!) Some people with extensive knowledge make bad engineering officers, and some of the best engineering officers simply prattle off terms without any clue how they work. Of course, the very best engineers know what they're talking about and can toss around terms that make sense. And you're here because you want to be the very best. Right?</p><p>Now then, some things to keep in mind when RPing in engineering:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Being a miracle worker may make for great humor and character development, but it is very easy to get carried away. Even more than security, the miracle worker engineer is the single most likely place to have "superhero" characters develop. Always watch yourself. If the framistan modulator is fused, consider it dead. If it's damaged, consider it repairable in an amount of time that will make it useful just barely in time to save everyone's life.</p></li><li><p>You can never have a system working too good. Well, that's not quite true. You can. If the ship's specs state that the ship is capable of warp 8.9, then it may be possible to squeeze 9.1 or 9.2 out of it for a few minutes, at the risk of the whole thing blowing up in your face (which is up to the GM to decide). But don't expect to "rig" the engines to pull 9.5 or 9.7. They can't do it. This also comes under the heading of don't abuse your power, or your power distribution systems.</p></li><li><p>The Chief Engineer especially but other engineers as well should make it his personal responsibility to know the ship forwards and backwards. If there are specs posted for a ship, read them several times and memorize them forwards and backwards. Have a bookmark for them for easy access. And follow them. The CE is normally the person to bring up the special perks of each class. Be sure that you know what they are, and use them appropriately. The CO and CE are the two people in the best position to help create a "personality" for the ship, even if it doesn't have on of those neato Nyetscape AI systems.</p></li><li><p>If something is broken but you don't know what, use a name that sounds reasonable that you heard them complaining about on the show. If the shields are damaged, the shield emitters could be off-line (read: repairable), they could be fused or destroyed (read: beyond all hope until they are suddenly and miraculously fixed at the start of the next mission), or they could be damaged (read: repairable but maybe not in time). If the phasers don't work, it could be the emitters -- the actual crystals that fire the beam -- it could be the generators which make the energy in the first place, it could be the conduits between them, or it could be something else. The EPS system is the 24th century equivalent of the electrical wiring, although it doesn't run on electricity. When in doubt, try and think what Geordi would yell at the comm system while things were exploding.</p></li><li><p>If you are the CE, then like any good Department Head, you should make sure your underlings have something to do. During off time this could be running a diagnostic or tweaking the system to be even better. Work with your junior officers, not over them. If everything is exploding and you're under attack from the Evil GM's Nameless Aliens, make sure that everyone is in charge of something. Tell some people to handle repairs while others work on finding the miracle weapon or weakness that saves the day. And make sure that you are in one of those groups.</p></li><li><p>Speaking of that miracle weapon, the same warning that goes for superheros goes for superweapons. One of the hardest fine lines you will have to walk as an engineer is the line between what you think you should be able to do and what you can do in the context of the RPG.</p></li><li><p>For those of you who are still trying to aust your CE and take his job, be sure to stand out as a solid RPer, not as a grandstander. One of the easiest traps to fall into is that of superhero or grandstander. Always keep an eye on yourself. Aside from character development and off-duty activity that is uniform to all departments, engineering junior officers should involve themselves in the workings of the ship. If you have no assignments from the CE or CO, interact with your fellow engineers (including NEs) and tweak systems. Often, however, your biggest challenge when things aren't happening will be interacting with other officers, not the machinery. Even engineers need to have lives.</p></li><li><p>Know your GM's style. Some GMs like to give engineering a hard time and make them do all the work. Others tend to ignore it. Figure out how your GM works and play into it. If nothing is happening make something happen. Not a core breach, but a fluctuation, or a misalignment. Force the GM to remember that you're there. If the GM seems to have a vendetta against engineering, do your best to keep up and try and steer problems to other departments, such as science.</p></li><li><p>As in any situation, the GM has the final say. You can appeal what the GM says to the FComm and GMDir, but assume that the GM is always right. Even if in reality what you are doing is perfectly legitimate, if the GM says you can't do it, you can't do it.</p></li><li><p>Remember what you learned in the first two lessons. They will come in handy when fixing major systems, as you can play around with them, as well as find new ways to do things that are the exact same thing but sound cooler, so they will work better for the next 10 minutes, just in time to save the ship.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="eng-104"></a>Build your own</h2></div></div></div><p>It can be truly said that captains have it easy. All they have to do is tell the ship what to do and it does it. We engineers on the other hand have the task of actually getting the ship to do what it's told. That daunting task is known as Starship Design. In this class we will discuss the intricacies of designing a new starship or technology for STF use.</p><p>"Let us redefine progress, to mean that just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing." When the President of the Federation spoke those words at the Khitomer Peace Conference, he was in fact referring to engineering. That holds true especially in STF's ED, where there are limitations to what can be done above and beyond the physical constrains of the universe. These limits exist because STF is not a place where we say "wouldn't it be cool if" but "wouldn't it be great for an RPG if."</p><p>"You know engineers, they love to change things." Anyone who follows modern technology can attest to the validity of this statement. Just when you thought they had found the best way of doing something, some engineer comes along and finds a different way of doing it, which as often as not is worse than the previous method. In STF, this is a curse you as an engineer want to avoid, especially where it involves core technologies such as warp drive.</p><p>Here are some items to keep in mind while designing your dream ship:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Remember that people will be RPing on this ship. Don't design a ship that you think would be neat for people to look at. Don't design a ship that would be great against the Jem'Hadar. Don't design a Borg killer. Design a ship where STF members can Role Play. That means even a specialty ship -- one that focuses on warfare, science, medical, etc. -- should be well rounded. It should also have enough weaknesses that it won't be able to destroy the entire Dominion Fleet. While it may be tempting to design one of these superships, and even if you think it could be done, that doesn't make it a good ship in the STF context.</p></li><li><p>Don't reinvent the wheel. If it travels at warp, let it use a warp core. You don't need to recreate FTL drive, because you can't. Warp drive is not possible with our current understanding of the Universe, and the nature of the Star Trek Universe is not clear enough to determine how warp drive works now, much less replace it with something bigger and better. The same holds true for phasers, shields, warp cores, and other main technologies. And don't be ashamed to borrow ideas from other ship designs in STF. Building on the backs of giants is an established practice in science and in STF. Just make sure you give explicit credit to the initial design and designer. Otherwise it's plagiarism, and don't expect a ship to pass then.</p></li><li><p>Be creative. If the last paragraph seemed to suggest that you shouldn't be creative at all, then you missed the point. New technology isn't bad. It can be fun and constructive, and make for some really nice RPGs. But you need to make sure that your new technologies are very well described, and that they work. For instance, if you are designing a new weapon, then make sure that the way it works makes sense in terms of the Star Trek context. It has been established in numerous episodes that lasers are of almost laughable impact on Starfleet ships. That's why everyone uses phasers and disrupters. So don't try and make lasers bigger and better, try and make phasers bigger and better. Or try to invent a replacement for the phaser. But if you are planning to invent a new technology, be forewarned: Expect a lot of setbacks. It is not uncommon for a new technology to simply not be up to snuf, and therefore not be passed in any form. You should not take it as an attack against you, but a statement that the technology is unfounded, unnecessary, or unworkable.</p></li><li><p>Don't overdo it. There are a series of recommendations that the ED often makes repeatedly, so I will collect them here so that they need only be said once, thus saving bandwidth and server space. The most important of these is speed. It is very tempting to make a ship faster than the last on, and then even faster than that. Unfortunately, physical constraints and playability make this a bad idea. Impulse speeds, for instance, are measured in terms of a fraction of the speed of light. The Galaxy-class Enterprise-D, for instance, had a maximum cruising speed of .25c, that is, one quarter the speed of light. Theoretically, it could push itself up to .92c, but doing so did nasty things to the structure of the ship and caused all sorts of time dilation relativity problems. In fact, those relativity concerns kick in, realistically, around .4c. For that reason, the STF Engineering department has officially stated that ships are restricted to under .35c impulse speeds in their fundamental design, and well below .35c is strongly encouraged. Lest this seem too unreasonable a suggestion, keep in mind that even at .27c a ship could easily outrun the Enterprise-D, and that the GMD has also made it clear that enemy ships must follow the same restrictions. Warp is not quite as stringent, but there energy and playability concerns come into play. Remember that warp is measured on a logarithmic scale. Warp 9 isn't 9 times the speed of light, it's 1516 times the speed of light. That's pretty darn fast. Also, as the warp speed increases the energy requirements increase, to the point that warp 10 is both infinite velocity and and infinite energy requirements, just as under Einsteinian physics the speed of light requires infinite energy. And when speed increases much farther than warp 9, the power usage increases faster than the speed, so warp 9.4 is actually far less efficient than warp 9.1. In terms of playability, the speed should also not be too fast, as it makes for nonsense RPGs. In fact, in many cases a slower ship can be better than a fast one when it comes to Role Playing. In practice, a maximum warp speed of 9.8 should be sufficient for both physical constraints and RPG usage, as well as satisfy the innate desire to say "Mine is faster than yours." Yes, some ships seen in the show have a higher max warp speed, but in order to make RPGs more challenging this is the STF limit. Most ships, however, can make do with far less than that and still be great designs, depending on their purpose. Staying far under these caps will increase the chances of a ship being approved.</p></li><li><p>Use standard notation. That means that you should always use the SI system of measurement, more commonly known as metric. Mass is measured in kilograms, distance in meters, and time in seconds, in all cases. When referring to super-high speeds, use a fraction of c, the speed of light. Avoid the complicated and unwieldy Imperial system (also known as English, also known as American, also known as that-damn-system-with-feet-and-pounds) like the Bolian Plague.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="eng-105"></a>References</h2></div></div></div><p>The question often arises, if one person says one thing, and a second person says another thing, who is right? The answer is often both, but then which do you go with? In this lesson we discuss the hierarchy of sources that are considered valid references. Though there is much disagreement about some sources, a set system needed to be established for sanity's sake.</p><p>The criteria for validity in this list is based upon two assumptions. First, like the producers, it is assumed that only the TV show and movies are valid. While there have been a great many novels published in the Star Trek Universe, many of them very good, they often contradict each other. It is also impossible to keep up with all of them. For that reason, novels are not considered canon, in general.</p><p>There are a few special cases. The cartoon series of the original cast was not produced by Paramount and Rodenberry, so it too is ignored by the producers. Therefore, we overlook it as well. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is sometimes considered to be apocryphal as well. In fact, it is rumored that Rodenberry liked to ignore it, so that is also on the exempt list. Finally, there is the Voyager episode that is a disgrace to the series, "Threshold." Supposedly, by finding a new, more stable type of dilithium Tom Paris is able to use a shuttle to break the warp 10 barrier, which causes him to evolve at a highly accelerated rate along the predefined course of human evolution. After fans stopped laughing at the utter stupidity of the episode, most agreed that it was safest to pretend it never happened, as it is the worst break of scientific rules, both modern and Star Trek, in 30 year history of the series.</p><p>The second assumption is that there are a select number of books published by people like Mike Okuda and Herman Zimmerman that are also considered valid resources. These are different from the often useful but non-canon books from other authors. Only those written by the production staff are valid. In order of prescience, these are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Deep Space Nine Technical Manual</em></span>, by Herman Zimmerman, Rick Sternback, and Doug Drexler, published 1998.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual</em></span>, by Rick Sternback and Michael Okuda, published 1991.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Star Trek Encyclopedia: A Reference Guide to the Future</em></span>, CD-ROM or 2nd Edition book, by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda, published 1997</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future</em></span>, 2nd Ed, by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda, published 1996.</p></li></ol></div><p>When in doubt, go with what these books say. In addition, modern science is always valid, unless Star Trek physics has contradicted it, in which case Star Trek physics takes precedence.</p><p>You will likely object to this list, but this is the list the STF Administration has agreed upon, because these are the most readily available and reliable sources. Numerous other sources may be useful references, and may sometimes be referred to, but when in doubt, the above texts are right, and others not wrong, just ignored.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="eng-conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div></div><p>Engineering is one of the most interesting departments in STF, both in an RPG and out of it. It's also one of the most dangerous. The potential for supercharacter problems is extreme. There's also the risk of superships and supertechs in the ED, and in the course of an RPG.</p><p>Engineering is also one of the most rewarding departments. It is the one most closely tied into the ship, and therefore often sets the pace for anything regarding hardware. If you know how to check yourself and are willing to take the time to learn, you will be rewarded with a memorable RPG experience even the Captain will envy.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="eng-exam"></a>Exam</h2></div></div></div><p>Submission Instructions</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Write out your answers to the questions below.</p></li><li><p>E-mail them to the course grader: <a href="mailto:larry@garfieldtech.com" target="_top">Larry Garfield</a></p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Be sure to include your full name at the top of the e-mail!</em></span></p></li><li><p>Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send the original question, just the answers.</p></li><li><p>Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send your answers as an attachment.

The goal of the course is to give you a better understanding on how to role-play an STF medical character, and to give you hints and tips that will hopefully make you excel in that role. At the end of the course, there will be a short exam to test your newfound abilities.</p><p>The first thing to mention about the role of the medical character is that they are not engineers, science officers, nor security personnel, (although they may well be proficient with a matter inducer, Seismograph, or a phaser and had security training, there are other officers on the ship for that role). As a doctor, it should also be pointed out, that a doctor's number one directive is to the well being of his patient's and those that are sick and injured. This doesn't mean you should mutiny the ship to get your way, but plead to the captain's better side.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="med-101"></a>Your Character</h2></div></div></div><p>OYou have a choice of 3 characters to role-play. These are medic, nurse, and doctor.</p><p>The role most people choose is that of the doctor. The other roles are a little restricted in what they can do. For example, a medic would not perform surgery on patients, as they would lack the necessary training.</p><p>Below is a brief summary of how I would categorize the three roles that you can choose from.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e7299"></a>Medic</h3></div></div></div><p>The way I look at the role of a medic, I would class it as that of an orderly or lab assistant, albeit one that has been trained in more that just first aid. Their main job is to assist the doctors and nurses in their duties on the ship. The training that they would have received would be considerably higher than that of a first-aider by today's standards. After all, the technology is considerably higher, and as the computer diagnosis' most illnesses and injuries, I would think that they would be allowed to treat minor problems. Of course in emergency situations they are allowed to treat patients to stabilize them in order to get them to a doctor.</p><p>Other major roles of the medic are labwork, and the care of the equipment. The medic would be able to perform simple lab duties such as blood and DNA analysis, and other similar tests. The responsibility of caring for the equipment would also fall on them. They would be responsible for the storage, the cleaning and the diagnostics of it.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e7306"></a>Nurse</h3></div></div></div><p>The role of the nurse is not too far different from that of the medic. The differences are the medical tasks they do. Their main task, apart from aiding the doctors in treating patients, is the welfare of the patients in sickbay. They carry out the routine treatments on the patients, whether they are in or out patients. Their training would be more advanced than that of a medic, but in their quiet periods, they would assist the medics in caring for the equipment.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e7311"></a>Doctor</h3></div></div></div><p>As mentioned before, this is the role most people take on. It is less restrictive on duty, as the doctor can carry out all the tasks of nurses and medics and much much more. This is the character I would recommend you choose.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e7316"></a>My 2 Cents</h3></div></div></div><p>Unless you are a strong role-player, I would recommend you choosing the Doctor. The other two roles will require much on your behalf, as it would be up to you to find things to do not the GM.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="med-102"></a>Species</h2></div></div></div><p>No, this isn't your character species; it's everybody else's character types. The majority of STF characters are probably human but there are many other types too, such as Klingon, Trill, and El Aurian, to name but a few.</p><p>I would have liked to write quite a bit about the medical side of the species in the Star Trek arena, but unfortunately, the information is pretty much non existant. In STF, you can look at the IC Library under the GMDept for race information. Also places like startrek.com carry plenty of information about the different races, (again not in a medical sense), although it does contain many diseases and equipment in its library databanks.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="med-103"></a>Equipment</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the most important things about being a Doctor, Nurse, or medic in the 24th century is knowing the equipment you have at your disposal.

How do they work? You ask.</p><p>If you look at Star Trek, there are more people on the ship/station than the six or so main characters. What you're doing by creating a NPC is making a character that only has a bit part in the sim, like the extras on the set.</p><p>You don't create the character as a 2nd character on a ship; you create it to interact with your character or somebody else character who needs the medical department. For example, if the ship you are on is a bit lacking in the med dept (a CMO and a Med-1 only), and both of these are on an away mission, that leaves the sickbay unattended should people need it. What you or the CMO should do is have a NPC tending sickbay till one of you returns.</p><p>As another example you have been given a task to do, but you, as most Doctors in hospitals would, have a nurse or medic assist you. Yes, you could have the med-2 assist, but that would slow the R-P down waiting for the posts. An alternative is to create a NPC Nurse or Medic to assist, and you R-P the character.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="med-conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div></div><p>You have now completed the Star-Fleet Academy Medical Course, well almost.

You wish to journey to Far and distant worlds, meet new and ancient civilisations. And then kill them. Well if so you've come to the WRONG place. Check the Klingon Empire recruiting poster three doors down in the Halls of the Spanish Inquisition.</p><p>&#8220;<span class="quote">NOBODY expects a Spanish Inquisition</span>&#8221;</p><p>So, leave that Phaser in your spare Duty Uniform. Don't worry you ARE going to get to use it. But first a word from our sponsors. The Spanish Inquisition.</p><p>&#8220;<span class="quote">NOBODY expects a Commercial Break</span>&#8221;</p><p>Okay, now lets get this straight right from the start. Security Officers if they are lucky, get to fight a drunken Klingon in the mess every once in a while. They do Away teams, they are more of a police force then anything else, and on the very odd occasion they get to repel the boarders the evil Game Master sends to remove the entirety of stuff you never thought was important. This means that shipboard combat is a rare and treasured thing for a Security Ensign, the quintessential arse kickers of the fleet. However Star-fleet expects every member wearing a Security Uniform and carrying a Phaser Rifle to be experts in the martial arts, and MIT's. No it's not a College near Cambridge. It's actually a term you&#8217;re going to want to be familiar with. But that's for a page coming soon.</p><p>If you're still sure that security is still you, head for the next page; Sec 101.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sec-101"></a>The Jack of all Trades and all around can do guy</h2></div></div></div><p>Alright, welcome to Boot Camp, for the next 6 or so pages your going to be instructed in what it means to be a security Officer, what a Sec Officer is supposed to do, and given some ideas on how to get it done. Phasers will automatically be surrendered to the Quartermaster upon entry. You're not on the Firing range, nor on the Stalker course. That said, enjoy........</p><p>The Security Officer, is first and fore most, a peace maker. In Tsan Zsu's the Art of War, it states that the warrior must at all times strive towards a state of perfection. A capable capacity for death. So that he does not have to deal it. This is the core principle and fundamental value at heart of being a Security Officer. Strive for perfection in your ability to impose your will by force of arms, so that you never have to do so. In other words, the training is designed to give you one thing, a choice. Security is all about choices remember, know and live this. You will be responsible for the safety and the lives of everyone onboard ship. This is not a responsibility to be taken lightly, or for granted. So you are going to be taught Situational Awareness, and Response skills. For example arming all the security department with Type IV concussion rifles, Anastazine grenades and shaped anti-Matter charges, as well as Tritanium composite riot shields to hunt down one truant child avoiding school, would be a over reaction, to say the least. Although it might be fun, it would be a complete waste of department resources, and manpower.</p><p>Your role aboard ship is simple. Easy to learn, yet even harder to master. You are inter-personal diplomats, a police force, Marines, Counselors. Intelligence operatives, Tactical staff, Counter-Terrorist soldiers, emergency doctors, field engineers. The Security Officer is therefore called the Jack of All Trades, and Master of None. (Note: this doesn&#8217;t give you a broad license to do whatever you like in any department.) It would be impossible for one course to cover this broad instructional field. The Ship's small arms Phasers are kept in the locked box, only for use on the firing range or training. So please always remember, unless there's an order given specifically for Phaser's, combat is going to confined to practise, training missions or drills. And me and the Sergeant-Major here, we love to train. Two bonus points to anyone who can tell me where that came from.</p><p>&#8220;<span class="quote">NOBODY expects an obscure quote.</span>&#8221;</p><p>The defining quality however of a Security Officer is his ability to achieve objectives. Whether small like the capture of one ignoble mouse, or large, repelling Borg once they've established a habitat. The Security Officer must at any point in time be able to instantly size up a room, identify threats, sleepers and get to the heart of the matter within moments. Otherwise the probabilities are quiet high that he'll wind up dead, or incapacitated, and capture is also a thing to be kept in mind. These skills are developed for protecting the crew, not to mention keeping you alive. Hopefully this will put you on the right track to developing those skills. The Security Officer must have an approachable, conciliatory YES attitude.</p><p>Alright now, Quartermaster, escort the staff to the Holodeck and issue them all training Phasers. (Didn't think I was going to give you something big straight up did you)</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sec-102"></a>The Means or the Ends. An Abject lesson on Options</h2></div></div></div><p>Alrighty recruits, gather round. Within this section of the course, you&#8217;re going to be shown situational examples, and then debriefed on the course of action taken. Before I begin, I want you to consider one thing for me. The age old question, the means or the ends. Ultimately the decision is up to you, but I'll want an answer on your exam. So start thinking about it now.</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with a base example of Situational Awareness, and means to an end. A Security Officer walks into Ten Forward, the lights are low, and there is no-one there. Rather strange considering we're at Green Alert general quarters haven't been called, there is no known emergency, plus it&#8217;s almost 1800 hrs. He calls for lights and the computer is unable to respond. What currently are his options, they are as follows. Call it into security, report it as odd and proceed anyway. Draw his Phaser and proceed, or back out the door, and call for another Sec member in to investigate. Which one would you have chosen?</p><p>Well because you can't know for this situation, here's what was going on. It was the Officer's birthday, and a few friends had arranged for Ten Forward to be vacated so when he was getting off his duty shift at 1730 hrs he would be able to walk into a surprise party.</p><p>Results of actions, 1 Security logs the call and they send a team into investigate within 15 minutes should he not report back, the Officer walks into his surprise party. He is thoroughly surprised and logs it with security, with a few chuckles shared all round. 2 He draws his Phaser he walks in and when someone jumps up he fires at them, it ruins the surprise by having someone sent to sickbay, and the Officer has his Phaser privileges revoked for a few weeks. 3 A security member comes and as they investigate Ten Forward, the surprise occurs and scares the hell out of them. They laugh it off and enjoy the party. In this case the wrong action most certainly was drawing his Phaser and approaching the dimly lit area. However if there had been insurgents inside that room instead of friends, number one would have gotten him killed, and the Security team walking into an ambush. Number two would have seen him kill a few before dying, and number three would have most likely seen him survive and report their presence so a team could come running, only this time knowing what they where walking into.</p><p>Note: Very few people ever survive an ambush.</p><p>Next the Stalker Course.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sec-103"></a>Staying Alive, A haha ha Staying alive, Staying Alive</h2></div></div></div><p>&#8220;<span class="quote">NOBODY expects an outbreak of Saturday Night Fever, even me.</span>&#8221;</p><p>Alright it's that time of day, Quarter Master, break out the Type III Phaser Rifles, it's time to send them off to the Stalker Course</p><p>Note: This part of the training Course is a area in a dry river, it's filled with poles driven into the ground and car tires placed on them to obstruct a straight view, targets then pop up and you have a weapon to stalk and kill them.</p><p>Now, eventually you're going to come into a place and time when combat IS required, as a matter of fact, training is probably the thing you&#8217;re going to be doing the most. So let&#8217;s give you the info that you&#8217;re going to need for the martial arts component of your simming.</p><p>The system that is used is a variant of TB, and stands for Turn Based, this means players take a turn and post a set of movements within the forms allowed for by the rules. Generally a Block Move Strike set, then the other player gets his turn and so on and so forth. A hit occurs when a player can't block or avoid a movement, according to the laws of physics. You must be descriptive down to your stance exactly and post how you&#8217;re moving exactly. Combat then becomes an elegant dance of moves rather then I say I hit you, you say I didn't, but you hit me in return, to which I say you didn't. *Sigh*, yes it happens only too often, regardless, the introduction of full TB, will allow a form for which players can fight other players without arguments. Or accusations of modeing. (Modeing is the term used to imply that you have done something not humanly possible simply because you *felt* like it, or didn&#8217;t want your character hit/hurt/damaged)</p><p>Congratulations, you've successfully reached the half way point. The next sections deal with Tactics. Don't worry; there are no Security Restrictions on them. This is designed to give you an idea of how a Professional soldier thinks, and acts, within an operational environment.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sec-104"></a>MIT for the follower</h2></div></div></div><p>Now for that elusive acronym you've all been wondering after. MIT stands for Minor Infantry Tactics, it deals with the Tactics used by individual soldiers, and provides advice and reminder points for a Section Leader. This section is devoted for the individual; the next section will be for the leader of a group. Should you ever be put in charge of something or wind up in the unenviable position of DH then your most likely going to want some advice on how to lead your men into battle. Or perhaps what to do when you conduct a group training exercise?</p><p>Alrighty; now where to begin? Ahh yes this should do.</p><p>TEAM. It stands for Together Everyone Achieves More. This means that in a hostile situation the Team will either accomplish the objective, or the team will fail to meet there objective. There isn&#8217;t a single case of One Security Ensign actually accomplishing a mission without dying or other people to aid him (TOS +VOY) There is no I in TEAM. Up to a thirty percent casualty rate is termed by Star-Fleet as acceptable losses, Worf himself made mention that in a war up to fifty percent was acceptable, however for the Security team, one casualty is completely un-acceptable. Therefore your movements should reflect this fact.</p><p>A team was also invented because it gave the enemy someone else to shoot at :)</p><p>Combat itself has three key components. Contact. Engagement. Withdrawal.</p><p>Contact is the part of battle where two opposing forces meet, exchange a volley or two. And a couple of casualties are generally sustained on both sides. During the contact phase, most likely for a planned engagement, lines are being established, arcs of fire and kill zones are being put in place.</p><p>Note : If two sides exchange small amounts of fire then retreat after contact, it is majoritively termed as a firefight.</p><p>Engagement</p><p>Two sides go through the motions of killing each other, this is where the metal meets the meat for lack of better words. This is where tactics, troop placements and such come into play. This section can last for several hours, days or even months. It all depends on you and the enemy. Withdrawal</p><p>The Battle having been decided will resolve into one side either retreating, or the other side having crushed the opposition. And if crushing is the order of the day, will rotate fresher troop to push through the breaches created if available.</p><p>Now when one engages an enemy, if you employ a contact drill, then the chances of being hit in the initial contact lessen significantly. Contact Drill is as follows, drop to the ground on your chest, and, if this removes you from there sight you roll over twice look up to find a target to sight in on. Then roll back one and pop up and fire.</p><p>In shipboard combat, contact drill because of the lack of available cover becomes redundant. However you can modify it to match ship&#8217;s conditions. Therefore one might use the following procedures.</p><p>In a Clearing action a team of three clear critical areas, one drops to the floor, the other launches a grenade of some variety, then hits a knee while the third supports from the standing position behind whatever cover is available. This is due to the fact that federation vessels where designed with long coverless decks, because the advent of below decks combat, are supposed to be an infrequent thing. As opposed to the TOS and ENT eras, in which all the decks are designed with plenty of cover for security forces to fight from. As boarding actions happen frequently. Covering fire is also another consideration to be made, moving only while a team mate covers you will save you from being put up like a pigeon on a wire. This is true in reverse, covering a team mate while he is moving is a very good thing.</p><p>The last thing we need to discuss is communications, now star-fleet has encrypted transmitters supposedly making it impossible for an enemy to listen to your comms. However, this is not the only consideration. Alerting an enemy to the fact that you are there at all is not a good thing. Conversely if you run a scan on RF and other communications waves, you might just get lucky. Remember what we discussed about learning how to fight so you don't have to. If you can sneak up on an enemy unseen or unheard, you can take prisoners. Gain info and access to some otherwise previously unreachable places.</p><p>To counter this, remember the more technology you take with you the easier you will be to track. So take weapons your comm. Badge, perhaps some personal Armour and that's it. Now these things take a while for them to become ingrained into how you think, so don't worry if you don't quiet understand.</p><p>To go in or not to go in, this is the question that plagues everyone.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sec-105"></a>I'm going in</h2></div></div></div><p>Alright remember how I talked about MIT's for the leader last section. Here they are in all there glory detail.</p><p>If in doubt hold and set up a defensive line. (Wait for stuff to shoot) If in doubt after that, clear it out (Clearing Action). If still in doubt..........CHARGE. (Blow it up)</p><p>Simply put the leader needs to know how his troopies move, and be able to give them orders to where they can give the most fire while taking the least return fire. You must find a way of inflicting damage while staying clear of it yourselves. Cover is one thing to consider in this manner, covering fire and employing these tactics to aid in the moving of your troops.</p><p>Suppressive fire, this means basically put enough rounds into the general area of a hostile to force him to seek cover. The aim of suppressive fire is to limit a hostiles options, so that you can lead him into an area of highest possible kill with minimal casualties in return</p><p>Covering Fire, similar to supressive fire, however you are covering the movements of troops, this is simply designed so that you can safely move troops to where they can provide supressive fire and inflict damage.</p><p>Employing all your weapons, supressive fire while employing a grenade will often either incapacitate an enemy, or kill him outright.

The goal of the course is to give you a quick insight to the science field. The topics covered in this course are Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Astronomy. Also covered is the roleplaying aspect of a Star-Fleet science officer.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sci-101"></a>Chemistry</h2></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8215"></a>Atoms</h3></div></div></div><p>The world we see is only a fraction of what really exists in the universe. What our eyes fail to pick up is the existence of very small things, the building blocks of everything in the universe -- atoms.</p><p>Atoms are the smallest part of an element that still retain the uniqueness of that element. They are made of three basic things -- protons, neutrons, and electrons. These three subatomic particles are made of still smaller things called quarks.</p><p>Both protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus, or center, of the atom. Protons carry a positive charge, while neutrons carry none at all. Electrons are not found in the nucleus; they orbit it, ready to bond with electrons from other atoms. Electrons carry a negative charge. The amount of protons in a stable atom, or a pre-reaction atom, is equal to the amount of electrons. Electrons are arranged in layers, called shells, on the outside of an atom. Think of several concentric circles, and each electron as a point on one of the circles.</p><p>Sometimes, an atom is called an element. An element is a specific kind of atom, arranged in a specific way. Hydrogen is an element. It has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons. Gold is also an element. It has 79 protons and electrons, and 118 neutrons. The difference in the amount of protons, electrons, and neutrons is what makes each element unique.</p><p>All known elements are listed on a very useful device known as the Periodic Table of the Elements. On this table, elements are listed according to atomic number (how many protons they have), their atomic weight (the weight of the matter at the nucleus of an atom), and what types of elements they are (alkali metals, transition metals, alkali earth metals, other metals, nonmetals, noble gases, lanthanides, and actinides). New elements are constantly being added to the table, mostly in the form of artificially-discovered isotopes that exist for a few seconds, if that.</p><p>To find out how many neutrons an atom has, simply subtract the atomic number from the atomic weight.</p><p>Speaking of isotopes, an isotope is a different form of an element. If an element has one proton and one electron, it is an atom of hydrogen - no other element has one proton and one electron. If a neutron is added, the element no longer becomes hydrogen, but deuterium. Since the element has one proton and one electron, though, effectively giving some of the qualities of hydrogen, it is an isotope of hydrogen.</p><p>When two or more different kinds of atoms join together, the result is a molecule. A molecule is the building block of the compound. Some common molecules are those of water (two atoms of hydrogen, one of oxygen), carbon dioxide (one carbon atom, two oxygen atoms), and salt (one atom of sodium, one atom of chlorine).</p><p>Two or more molecules put together is called a compound. Some everyday compounds are water (H<sub>2</sub>0), calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), and sugar (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8251"></a>Bonding</h3></div></div></div><p>When atoms bond to form compounds, the whole atom is not involved. Instead, it is the electrons on the very outside shell that form bonds with electrons from the outer shells of other atoms. There are three different kinds of bonds -- ionic, where the two electrons bond with no sharing of electrical charge, non-polar covalent (the electrons share the charge), and polar covalent (the electrons share, but the larger one receives more of the charge for a longer amount of time).</p><p>An atom that has a positive or negative charge is said to be an "ion." Normally, atoms have no charge, as the amount of protons and electrons are equal and they cancel each other out. When an atom gives up or accepts more electrons, it becomes either positive or negative. The amount of positive or negative charge an atom has is called its valence.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8258"></a>Law of Conservation</h3></div></div></div><p>A very important rule when dealing with chemistry is the rule of conservation of atoms. It stipulates that in a chemical reaction, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. All of the atoms remain in existence, they may merely be free atoms now, or in combination with other atoms. The main point is that chemical reactions do not create or destroy atoms. Nuclear reactions, however, are a different case.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sci-102"></a>Biology</h2></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8266"></a>Organic Molecules</h3></div></div></div><p>The lives of all living things would cease to exist if not for four very important kinds of molecules, called organic molecules or bio-molecules.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8271"></a>Carbohydrates</h3></div></div></div><p>Carbohydrates are the first, and least important, kind of bio-molecule. The base compound of a carbohydrate is the monosaccharide. It is important to remember that when dealing with any kind of bio-molecule that breaking an atomic bond releases energy, and creating an atomic bond uses energy.</p><p>When many saccharides combine, they form a polysaccharide. This can be a chain of thousands of carbon atoms that takes hours for the body to break. Carbohydrates are the things an organism digests first.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8278"></a>Lipids</h3></div></div></div><p>Lipids are the next-highest kind of bio-molecule. They store large amounts of energy due to their double carbon bonds and look like a branched ladder. Lipids are used primarily as stored energy, as it is easier and more cost-effective to use carbohydrates first.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8283"></a>Proteins</h3></div></div></div><p>There is perhaps, no more important bio-molecule than the protein. Not only does it effectively repair the body and facilitate transport through cells, it is responsible for breaking things down and building them up. Proteins at their most important come in the form of enzymes that cause chemical reactions to happen faster or slower. It is enzymes (proteins) that are responsible for food digestion. Without enzymes, it would take 1,000 years to successfully digest your lunch.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8288"></a>Nucleic Acids</h3></div></div></div><p>These bio-molecules form the very backbone of our existence -- DNA and RNA. Nucleic acids in DNA come in the form of four kinds of chemical bases, called nucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine), that pair in the following ways: A-T or C-G. The different combinations of these bases are endless when there are thousands of them on a single strand of DNA. RNA is much the same, except that it has the base uracil instead of thymine. It bonds with adenine.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8293"></a>Cells</h3></div></div></div><p>Cells are "the building block of life," the smallest part of a living thing that can still be considered "alive." In the average human adult, there are an estimated 6 trillion cells of varying shapes and functions. It is in cells that energy production takes place and where wastes are disposed of.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8298"></a>Cell Organelles</h3></div></div></div><p>"Organelles" is the term applied to the sub-cellular structures inside the cell that perform the cell's duties. Here is a list of organelles, with a brief description of each: </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Ribosomes</span></dt><dd><p>These small, spherical organelles produce proteins.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Nucleus</span></dt><dd><p>The nucleus lies roughly at the center of the cell, and is the storage facility for the DNA. It is referred to as the "control center" of the cell.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Endoplasmic Reticulum</span></dt><dd><p>The "highway" of the cell, where monosaccharides are transported around the cell.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Golgi Bodies, Golgi Complex</span></dt><dd><p>These terms refer to the organelle that packages nutrients for storage or for shipping to another cell. It is the UPS of the cell.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Mitochondria</span></dt><dd><p>The powerhouse, processing molecules to make energy (the process of making energy is a very complex one).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Cell membrane</span></dt><dd><p>Also called a plasma membrane, this is the layer that protects the cell, holds in the cytoplasm, and allows transport (next lesson). Proteins are embedded in the cell membrane, and serve as doormen, allowing only certain molecules in, and helping molecules that need assistance.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Cytoplasm</span></dt><dd><p>The Jell-O like fluid in which resides the organelles. The cytoplasm stretches from the membrane to the nucleus.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Lysosome</span></dt><dd><p>Its root word sounds like "Lysol," the cleanser, and that's exactly what this organelle does -- it removes waste products from the cell.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Vacuole</span></dt><dd><p>A vacuole is just a large storage container. In plant cells, vacuoles are huge and filled with water.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Cell wall</span></dt><dd><p>This structure is found only in plants and adds an extra layer of rigidity to the cell. The bark of trees is nothing more than trillions of cell walls.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Chloroplast</span></dt><dd><p>This structure is also only found in plant cells. The chloroplast is responsible for photosynthesis, changing sunlight to chlorophyll. It is believed that the chloroplast and mitochondria evolved along somewhat the same lines.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8370"></a>Transport in the Cell</h3></div></div></div><p>In order for the cell to utilize nutrients, they must first be moved into the cell. Small molecules (monosaccharides) can move across the semi-permeable cell membrane in the process of diffusion. When one of the proteins in the membrane helps a molecule across the membrane, it is called facilitated diffusion. Water moves across the membrane in the process of osmosis. Both these kinds of transport are passive transport systems, meaning that no energy is required to move the molecules across the membrane, since the molecules are moving from a high to low concentration (like going downhill -- no energy needed). Active transport refers to any kind of movement across the cell that requires energy. Energy is needed because the concentration of molecules goes from low to high (like going uphill -- oops, energy is needed).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8375"></a>Living Things</h3></div></div></div><p>It is generally accepted that things are living if:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>They have the ability to grow and develop.</p></li><li><p>They have the ability to reproduce.</p></li><li><p>They have the ability to use energy.</p></li><li><p>They have cells.</p></li><li><p>They have the ability to adapt.</p></li></ol></div><p>In order for things to be considered alive, they must meet all of the above characteristics. It is also understood, though, that as new lifeforms are encountered, they may not meet all of the above criteria. In this case, it is up to the science officer to determine whether or not something is living.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sci-103"></a>Physics</h2></div></div></div><p>The only laws in the universe that are absolute are the laws of physics. The Earth scientist Sir Isaac Newton devised three Laws of Motion that have become the basis for the understanding of physics.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8403"></a>Newton's Laws</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>An object at rest tends to stay at rest; an object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by another force.</p></li><li><p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p></li><li><p>An object experiences motion because energy is transferred from one object to another.</p></li></ol></div><p>The force described in law 1 is inertia. Inertia is an object's tendency to stay at rest or in motion. The larger the object, the greater the inertia, both ways. If you are pushing a heavy box up a hill, more energy is required to put the box in motion. Once in motion, the box is easy to push or pull. If it slides down the hill, it is hard to stop because it is already in motion (although gravity plays a part in its motion down the hill).</p><p>The "other force" described in law 1 is friction. Friction is what causes objects to eventually slow down and stop. It occurs when two surfaces contact each other, and does happen with air (when it happens with air it is known as "drag"). An object only continues to move in a vacuum, such as in space, where there is no air and no friction.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8420"></a>Gravity</h3></div></div></div><p>Gravity is a universal phenomenon, felt even in space. On a planet, gravity pulls all objects toward the center of the planet, effectively keeping them on the ground. It is not limited to this definition, however. Gravity is a force exerted by objects upon other objects that causes two objects to attract to one another.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8425"></a>Movement of Objects</h3></div></div></div><p>All objects have something called "momentum," the product of mass multiplied by velocity. Mass is the overall size of an object - its weight and size measurements (a bowling ball has more mass than a tennis ball). Velocity is an object's speed.</p><p>The Earth philosopher Aristotle first posed the idea that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. The renaissance scientist Leonardo da Vinci thought that objects fell in proportion to the distance they have fallen, but it wasn't until the 17th century that astronomer Galileo Gaileli got it right - small and heavy objects fall at the same speed. The proportion is how long objects have been in the air. When objects have been in the air for a long time, only then do heavier objects' momentum begin to act and they land before lighter objects.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8432"></a>Relativity</h3></div></div></div><p>In the 1930s, Albert Einstein proposed that space was curved and because of this, light also curved. This was his general theory of relativity. His special theory, known widely because of its application to warp power, is that energy = matter times the speed of light squared (E=MC<sup>2</sup>). It means that as one gets closer to the speed of light, energy consumption increases along with the momentum of the matter going at the speed of light.</p><p>An offshoot of Einstein's special theory is that, as objects approach the speed of light, time begins to slow down for them because they are going so incredibly fast. As a result, an object at near-light speed can be in motion for a year while it seems that dozens of years have passed to an object at "normal" speed. This is why impulse power is limited to 0.25c or at the most, 0.5c and why starships do not travel for extended time at impulse speed. Traveling any faster at sublight, or for longer amounts of time, will result in an increased time dilation effect.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sci-104"></a>Astronomy</h2></div></div></div><p>Astronomy is the study of space, and this is the duty of most science officers. It is important to understand the basics of astronomy - planets, stars, black holes, since these are the things you will encounter.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8447"></a>Heavenly Bodies</h3></div></div></div><p>Planets, stars, and other solid stellar phenomena are lumped together into this category. Planets are dense balls of matter that have gravity, a core, and can sometimes support life. They do not produce their own power. Planets range in size from the small Pluto to the giant Jupiter, which could have been a star.</p><p>A star is a huge ball of gases that uses the process of fusion (covered in the Engineering course) to create energy. A star's immense gravity sometimes pulls planets, asteroids, and comets into its orbit, creating a solar system. There are two classifications of stars - by size and by luminance. In ascending order, the sizes of stars are dwarf, main sequence, giant, and supergiant. Their luminance scale is, in ascending order, red, yellow, blue, and white. Stars adopt the Bell curve - a small amount are red dwarfs, a small amount are white supergiants, but most are yellow and blue medium-sized stars. These medium-class stars are referred to as main sequence stars.</p><p>At the end of a large star's life, it uses up the remainder of its fuel in a split-second and explodes with the power of and luminance of thousands of Earth suns. This explosion, which can and does destroy solar systems, is called a supernova. Smaller stars do not go nova; they swell up to a larger size and cool down or turn into planet-sized stars called white or black dwarfs.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8456"></a>Galaxies</h3></div></div></div><p>Galaxies are large collections of solar systems that are millions of light-years in diameter. Galaxies are classified into three types: spiral (the Milky Way) elliptical (the Andromeda galaxy), and irregular (the Magellanic cloud). Galaxies that are neither spiral nor elliptical fit into the irregular category. It is estimated that there are 100 billion galaxies in our universe.</p><p>At the edge of the Milky Way galaxy is a large energy barrier called the Galactic Barrier. In 2265, Captain Kirk and the USS Enterprise crossed this barrier, causing a mutation with one of the crew members. It is advised that ships do not cross this barrier.</p><p>Equally dangerous is the Great Barrier, an energy barrier surrounding the center of the galaxy. Captain Kirk crossed this barrier in 2285 with the Enterprise-A. What he find inside was a malevolent, but powerful, creature that attempted to commandeer the ship by posing as God. The being was destroyed, but it is unknown if others like him exist. Crossing the Great Barrier is also inadvisable.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8465"></a>Stellar Phemonena</h3></div></div></div><p>Pulsars are the remains of stars that have not gone nova. They shine with the luminance of millions of suns and are the most distant objects known to man.</p><p>Black holes are also the remains of stars that have not gone nova, but rather done the opposite. The star has condensed into a super-dense ball of matter a few miles wide. So dense is it, though, that its gravity is immense and not even light can escape. Its existence is known, though, due to massive amounts of gamma radiation that are emitted from the black hole. Upon entering a black hole, matter is pulled apart atom by atom. No one knows what lies beyond a black hole. Scientists speculate that it is probably a gateway to another universe or dimension.</p><p>A wormhole is a passage through space, first conceived of by Earth scientist Dr. Steven Hawking. Most wormholes are unstable, their endpoints shifting constantly through space. The only stable worm hole is in the Alpha Quadrant, several hundred kilometers from Bajor. It was created by that planet's Prophets and leads to the Gamma Quadrant.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sci-105"></a>Role Playing</h2></div></div></div><p>The life of a science officer is not easy. Most often, they are stuck with duties like OPS (yes, Data was a science officer) until something comes along that requires analysis. In space, nothing conforms to any set definition - a lifeform may be discovered that does not adhere to the definition of life, but it is most obviously living.</p><p>It is important that you have a general understanding of all the terms and concepts presented in this class, as your commanding officer will want to know exactly what it is that your ship has encountered. If you're not sure, don't pretend you know, as this will only lead to problems later. Speculate! Say, "My hypothesis is . . ." or "It's too early to gain a definitive answer, but I believe that . . ."</p><p>Launch probes to gather interstellar data. Work with the medical department to gather information about horrible infections. Use the laboratories on board to analyze different kinds of goo. Delegate - always delegate! A science officer, in a crisis situation, cannot handle everything at once, which is why there are junior officers to assist you.</p><p>When it comes to RPGing, don't be afraid to make conclusions. Don't wait for the GM to tell you what it is you've found, say what it is. At the worst, the GM will issue a nullified post order. It's never a crime to be too creative, but being under-creative is what keeps people at the sci-5 position.</p><p>Don't rely on the concepts of this class as your only source of scientific information. This is just a basic-level class; it's a lot like a liberal arts science class - we cover a lot of subject matter, but depth is sacrificed for quantity. Entire books have been written about cell structure and function and protein production. Stephen Hawking covered the contents of our astronomy class in the first few pages of A Brief History of Time. The stuff here is introductory material. Look at some science books, pay attention in science class. The GM probably knows a thing or two about real science, and if you know more, you can outfox him and come up with solutions the GM didn't think of.</p><p>The CSO is usually on an Away Team, so he should be ready for anything at all times.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sci-exam"></a>Exam</h2></div></div></div><p>Submission Instructions</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Write out your answers to the questions below.</p></li><li><p>E-mail them to the course grader: <a href="mailto:fitzador@gmail.com" target="_top">Mark Wilson</a></p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Be sure to include your full name at the top of the e-mail!</em></span></p></li><li><p>Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send the original question, just the answers.</p></li><li><p>Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send your answers as an attachment.

This course is designed with both the potential and veteran GM in mind. If you've got a story idea and you want to be a GM, this course will help you know what to expect when you get that first GM assignment. If you're a GM with one or one hundred sims under your belt, this course will give you ideas of how to be a better GM, and how to successfully make it through the rough patches that are bound to occur.</p><p>The first and most important thing for you to know before you move past this page is that a GM's job is to entertain his assigned crew. Contrary to a very popular belief, being the GM doesn't make you a puppetmaster nor a god. The crew isn't there to do your bidding; you're there to show the crew a good time.</p><p>Think of a GM as a cruise director. His job is to make sure all the passengers are happy and have things to do. He gives them a choice of activities from which to choose so they're not bored, even if it means everyone is doing something a little bit different. He also makes sure no one throws the deck chairs around. Just one passenger flinging a chaise lounge is liable to ruin the cruise for the others.</p><p>Being a GM requires juggling talent, ego, and humility within a ring of common sense. You have to be tolerant without being a pushover; strong without being overbearing; flexible without being unfocused; and most of all, able to put the needs/wants of the crew above your own personal desires.</p><p>Still think you have what it takes? Great! Let's proceed to the first lesson.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gm-101"></a>Finding Your Idea</h2></div></div></div><p>When you're a GM the first thing you need is a story. After all, it's hard to run a sim if you have no plot. There is no hard, fast rule on where to get story ideas. Inspiration is as unique as each GM, and can be found everywhere. Television, books, movies, magazines, even the news can provide story ideas. Look around, your next story could be hidden in the autumn leaves.</p><p>For me, I find a lot of inspiration from the STF characters, themselves. For instance, if the CO of the ship is a Bajoran, what better antagonist can you find besides a Cardassian? Or maybe another character has lost one spouse to divorce, and another to death. What would happen if that character were forced to marry to save a Federation alliance?</p><p>The plot is only limited by your imagination. However, there are a few guidelines to follow to make sure the crew loves the story as much as you do.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Make sure the plot is big enough to keep everyone busy. If it's not, you may have to add a secondary storyline to involve those left out.</p></li><li><p>Avoid scenarios used to death in STF, as well as plots your ship has seen before. Check with the CO of the ship to which you're assigned. Ask him if he has preferences. Make sure that the battle sim you have planned isn't going to be the third one in a row the ship's been dealt.</p></li><li><p>Familiarize yourself with your ship's class. A wonderful sim exploring the exobiology of a newly-discovered planet won't work well on a Trafalgar or Kansas. Just as sending a McCoy into battle is suicide. Determine a ship's capabilities ahead of time, too, so you don't have a ship doing a saucer seperation that would normally only be possible if it were blown in two.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your plot is plausible. Sure, it'd be really cool if the ship crash-landed, but unless the ship is capable of sub-orbital flight, don't expect it to fly again. Likewise you can't do anything that contradicts canon.</p></li><li><p>Finally, avoid rehashing Trek episodes and overusing Trek characters and ships. STF has its own ships. Rely on them. Keep appearances by Trek characters to cameos.</p></li></ol></div><p>Okay, you were out for a bike ride the other day and a great story idea came to you. You've read the guidelines, have studied the ship's specs, and made sure no one has done a story about wheeled aliens. What's next?</p><p>The next class. See you there.</p><p>TIP FOR THIS LESSON:</p><p>Your story idea cannot be so grandiose that it becomes a Trek version of the Neverending Story. If your story is one of sweeping proportions, you don't have to abandon it. Just break it down into individual sims, each one with an ending that segues into the next.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gm-102"></a>Turning the Idea into a Sim</h2></div></div></div><p>So you have your idea, now its time to turn that idea into a sim. For me, sitting down and planning a sim is one of the most enjoyable parts of being a GM. The creative process moves into full gear, and there is no limit to what a GM can imagine. The Planning Stage of a sim consists of creating the setting and the characters. GMs create the worlds that starship crews visit, ranging from an icy world at the edge of a solar system to a bustling spaceport filled with the slim of the galaxy. GMs also create the colorful cast of characters that will interact with the crew of the starship. Characters can include the dusty Starfleet admiral, the motherly diplomat, or the scheming villain. Whatever the GM ultimately conjures up at this point, there is one thing to keep in mind: The sky is the limit. Be creative. Be original. And above all, be daring.</p><p>But what of the plot? The plot marks a common stumbling block for many GMs. One common mistake it trying to plan the entire sim in the Planning Stage. This is impossible. The GM interacts with many real live people in a role-playing environment. Each role-player enters the arena with their own unique backgrounds, cultures, and viewpoints. This diversity greatly affects the way a sim plays out. The players push the sim in directions the GM may not have anticipated, as well as often bring new ideas and thoughts to the sim. This often forces the GM to improvise and may even spark new ideas the GM had not previously considered. The bottom line is this: The GM and the players are on the journey together. It is a symbiotic relationship. The GM presents the story and guides the crew through plot points, and the players challenge the obstacles and bring new ideas to the story, which may ultimately make the story better.</p><p>So how much plot do I need at the Planning Stage? Well, not a whole lot. The process of creating the plot for a sim is best likened to the making of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park III, which some of you may be familiar with.</p><p>For the making of Jurassic Park III, Spielberg had a solid beginning. So should a GM. The GM should have a good idea of the characters, the setting, and the major plot points that will get the story rolling. This must accomplish getting the crew where they should be, having the crew meet the people they should meet, and putting them into the situation that they are playing out.</p><p>For Jurassic Park III, Spielberg had a vague idea of how he wanted the movie to end. So should a GM. The conclusion, unlike the beginning, should not have major plot points. In all reality, a GM cannot predict the outcome of a sim. In my experience, a sim has never ended even close to how I thought it would. This is caused by the diversity of the players, which is normal. Therefore only a vague idea of where you are going should suffice for an ending.</p><p>Jurassic Park III was unique from most movies, in that Spielberg had no real idea of what would happen in the middle of the movie when he started filming. Although this is a bad way to make a movie, it is a perfect way to plan a sim. A GM should have no real middle part to a sim. A few plot points may sit in the back of a GMs mind, put these should not be set in stone. Things change and new directions are taken. New GMs will often try to hit their middle plot points. This can be frustrating when the crew heads off in another direction. GMs are often discouraged at this point. Instead, the GM should adapt, and go with the flow, or risk being inflexible. Inflexible GMs can often find themselves butting heads with players or causing the crew to lose interest in their sims. Neither of which is desirable.</p><p>The GM should enjoy seeing what direction the crew heads off in. One thing to keep in mind: Good sims keep the crew busy. A GM is required to constantly create new obstacles or challenges for the crew to encounter. Many ships and sims have suffered when players find there is 'nothing to do'. The GM must consider this when planning sims.</p><p>Also as a side note, the stronger and more experience GMs develop the ability to run a sim without a sim outline, working off their story idea and making the rest up as they go. Although this can be a rewarding experience I would recommend newer GMs plan a sim outline to assist in giving them direction.</p><p>TIP FOR THIS LESSON:</p><p>Make sure your story will make a good sim. The best way to do that is to remember that it's the journey to the end that satisfies a roleplayer. The story has to be interesting enough that the players want to see how it ends, and are willing to work through the obstacles you throw in their paths. Make the players care and you've got them to the end.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gm-103"></a>Running the Sim</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you have your idea, know more or less how your idea will play out in a sim, it is now time to review the methods you can use to present your sim. GMs have a couple of methods of giving information to the players and moving the sim along. They include Narrative posts, Interactive posts, and what I call Elsewhere Posts.</p><p></p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8832"></a>Narrative Posts</h3></div></div></div><p>The Narrative Post most often comes across as an all-knowing voice. In other words, the post from the GM knows all. These types of posts are generally used to accomplish two types of tasks, all though I am sure this list is not all-inclusive. The first task is to set a chain of events in motion.</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e8837"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Narrative Posts - Style One</b></p><p>Suddenly the rundown freighter the USS Anyname had been escorting exploded in a blinding flash of light, sending debris in all directions.</p></div><p>As you can see this post is meant to set the crew of the USS Anyname in motion. GMs often use this type of post to convey plot points of their sim.</p><p>The second way the Narrative post can be used is to convey information as a result of a player's action. Think of this as sensor readouts, diagnostic results, or data from the ships library computer. These posts come in handy when players try to gather more information in the sim.</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e8846"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Narrative Posts - Style Two</b></p><p>A player may post: Lt. Anywho activated the sensors and began to scan the debris. He desperately searched for any survivors from the explosion.</p><p>A GM's response would be: Sensors showed several life signs in the largest section of debris.</p></div><p>As you can see this type of post will often be instrumental in giving players feedback on the results of the actions they take.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8855"></a>Interactive Posts</h3></div></div></div><p>The Interactive Post can often be the most fun to write. These posts are usually in response to the sim characters you created in lesson two interacting with the players. A GM can use sim characters to convey all types of information, ranging from explaining why the villain of the sim is trying to destroy a planet, or what background information the Intelligence Agent has on certain smugglers. I encourage every GM to make your characters as real and as deep as the characters the role-players have developed. This will enrich your story and get the role-players to invest themselves in your characters.</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e8860"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Interactive Posts</b></p><p>A player may post: So did you notice anything unusual before you heard the explosion, "Lt Anywho asked as he interviewed the survivor.</p><p>A GM's response would be: The injured man, an elderly Bajoran, nodded to the question, "I heard weapons fire. Lots of it... I stuck my head out of the cargo hold to see what I could and that's when I saw a Cardassian running my direction!"</p></div><p>Here the GM has used a character he developed to convey information that the crew can now dig deeper into. The one thing about the Interactive post is that it is not an all-knowing character. The character should only know and be able to convey information that the character would reasonably have. So in the example, the Bajoran wouldn't know if the Cardassians were from a group of radicals out to resurrect the Bajoran occupation. The more creative the characters are, the more fun you and the crew will have role-playing it out.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8869"></a>Elsewhere Posts</h3></div></div></div><p>This type of post should really be used sparingly. Often times I have seen it used in moderation in the start and end of a sim. Basically, this is a post where one or more of the GMs sim characters are interacting with each other, or with themselves.</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e8874"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Elsewhere Posts</b></p><p>The Cardassian Commander shook his head as he saw the latest sensor readings. The Starfleet vessel had found survivors. This was not good. He slowly swiveled in his chair and turned to the helmsman. "Set an intercept course," he ordered, "Maximum warp."</p></div><p>As you can see this GM post takes place in an area where there cannot possibly be any of the role-players. Therefore, no players can respond or play off this post, since none of their characters would be aware of this. The benefit of using this post is to create suspense or a deeper understanding the players of what this sim is about. In the example, it now tells the player someone else is out there and could possibly come after the Starfleet crew. It creates anticipation, suspense, or can be used to close up a thread, or even a sim. Use this sparingly only because the sim is meant to get role-players involved. Just using Elsewhere posts basically means you are playing your sim to yourself. That can't be much fun!</p></div><p>A strong GM has mastered all these types of posts and is able to pull them together in perfect harmony to tell his sim and entertain the players.</p><p>TIP OF THE LESSON:</p><p>While I have yet to come across a quick sim in STF (most average five to sixth months), that doesn't mean you should let your sim meander along for years. Presenting a journey too long and arduous can make the players bored and/or frustrated long before they reach the end. And those obstacles I mentioned earlier, the ones you throw in the path of your crew to keep things interesting: Make sure they're surmountable. I remember a sim on a ship I commanded that resulted in the entire senior staff being locked in the holodeck. The engineers who remained free tried all kinds of things to break into the holodeck, but the GM never let them succeed. Rather than keep trying, the players went AWOL after two weeks of trying to solve the puzzle.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gm-104"></a>The Ways of the GM</h2></div></div></div><p>So you have your idea, turned it into a sim, know how to run your sim. That should be it right. Not quite. This lesson is designed to let you know the role of the GM on a starship. Most of the following rules and guidelines are simple common sense. All of them come from experience, a few are even laws. Pay attention. Abiding by them can make your GMing more pleasant; for you and your ship.</p><p>Now make like Charlton Heston and accept these Ten Commandments:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Thou shalt not destroy thine assigned starship without prior approval of the CO and FComm.</em></span> Very little can match the thrill of wreaking havoc to a starship. Many GMs I know delight in hull breaches, failed shields, and sparking bridge consoles. Before you lose matter/antimatter containment on that warp core, however, make sure you have the blessing of both the captain and fleet commander.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Thou shalt not covet thy captain's duties.</em></span> Some people think of the GM as the god. To some extent that's true. The GM dictates the fate of the players and the ship. He controls what happens in their lives. However, a GM's deity status doesn't extend beyond the story. The GM cannot and does not interfere with the running of the ship. He doesn't write Captain's Logs, he doesn't AWOL players, he doesn't redesign the MOTD, he doesn't give players positions on the ship. That is the captain's job.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Honor thy players' wishes.</em></span> I've said it before but I'll say it again. Your job is to entertain the crew. If the players are not enjoying your sim, makes changes. Ultimately, it doesn't matter if you think your sim is great unless the players agree.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Thou shalt not kill - until three Death Warnings are issued.</em></span> Once upon a time, a player character could not be killed unless the player said so. Unfortunately, this begat a series of super-being players who would have their characters do death-defying and often very stupid things in a sim. After all, characters couldn't die. So who was to stop someone from taking on six heavily-armed Klingons by himself? This abuse by a handful of players led to the adoption of a Three Strike Rule. If someone does something really stupid - something that would probably end up with the person being killed, maimed, or otherwise incapcitated - the GM can issue a Death Warning. If the same player persists in this type of posting, the GM can continue to issue Death Warnings. Upon issuance of the third warning, the GM is allowed to kill that character. Death Warnings are serious stuff. Don't issue them without due cause.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Honor Star Trek canon and keep it holy.</em></span> Always anchor your storyline with plausibility. It's true that the universe in which we play is one of science fiction, but that's no excuse to create things that don't mesh with Trek physics. If you're not sure about the plausibility of a plot point, research it. Here, ignorance is not bliss. By the same token, do not rewrite that which has been written. You cannot rewrite Trek history.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Follow thy chain of command.</em></span> In a perfect world, everyone would get along. Each day would be filled with sunshine and your work would be applauded by the newest ensign all the way to the most venerated admiral. What a shame our world isn't perfect. In our world, chances are pretty good that you're going to have a problem with one of your GM assignments. Maybe a player keeps writing counteractive posts. Maybe the captain isn't holding up his end. Maybe there's a personality clash. Whatever the problem, always remember to follow the chain of command. Start with the CO. If the problem can't be rectified, you then go to the fleet commander. If you still can't get resolution, you can approach the GM Director for input. Only after you've trod upon each rung above you without success do you go to the president.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Thou shalt not be a GM before being a GMT.</em></span> If you're not already a GM, you must participate in a GM Training program through the GM Department. It doesn't matter if you've mastered live action games and ran players through dozens of have-dice-will-travel dungeons. It doesn't matter if you're the best roleplayer in STF. Everyone must participate in the GMT program before being certified as a GM. If you are as good as you think you are, you'll be running people's lives in no time, anyway. A couple of months with a mentor looking over your shoulder isn't going to stop that from happening.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Know thine HTML and keep thy MOTD section current.</em></span> Every ship's page (MOTD) I've ever seen has a section for the GM. You use this space to keep the crew updated on what's happening. You can also use it to foreshadow events and provide other minutiae, such as names, places, what-have-you. The ship's CO provides this place for you as a courtesy. Don't abuse it. Be sure to update your section as often as necessary. Don't make your section so long it makes up more than half the MOTD's contents. Also, don't change the way the section is coded. If the CO has it set up as a paragraph with blue text, don't make it a bulleted list in pink. If you're unfamiliar with HTML code take extra precaution that you don't rip the MOTD to shreds by accident. It's best to be at least somewhat familiar with the basic codes before you go about changing anything.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Remember thine posting requirements and keep active.</em></span> With a ship's entire reality resting on the shoulders of the GM, it's vital that you post regularly. Never go AWOL. That means know the ship's posting requirements and stay well within them. Most require a post every three to four days. However, since your job is to entertain the crew, a more brisk posting regime may be necessary. Post as frequently as required to keep the story moving and remain within AWOL guidelines.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Thou shalt not antagonize thine enemies.</em></span> It's bound to happen. You are the GM on a ship with someone you don't like. Being a GM does not give you the authority to make that player's life hell. Sure it would be great fun to lock up your sworn nemesis with a lovestruck moose. Yes, assimilation may do wonders for another foe's personality. The temptation - even the justification - can be strong. Do not give in to it. Doing so only serves to shorten your GM career.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gm-105"></a>Advice to Remember</h2></div></div></div><p>Before you go, take a moment and read what other GMs throughout the years have said. It will be on the exam!</p><p>It was my first official sim. I planned the whole thing out, from beginning to end. I had every event worked out. I was very inflexible as the sim progressed, not having experience with running a sim. The result: The crew lost interest, and I had to narrate the end just to get the darn thing over with! That was my bad GM experience.</p><p>A new GM was supposed to take over [after my sim was finished]. When that person AWOLed, I was put in the GM spot again. This time, I had nothing planned - I hadn't expected to be GMing! As it turned out, this was a good thing. My next sim was very spontaneous, and I had no trouble compensating for crew interest and keeping all departments active. The crew posted almost 100% daily by the end. It went great. Overall, I would advise new GMs to be flexible. Don't hold to your perfect mental image of what should happen - make sure the crew's having fun. Don't plan everything, just have a couple of good ideas.</p><p>Be honest with the crew. If you make a mistake, admit it. Don't be afraid to be human. If a player posts something that you don't understand (a bit of physics you don't grasp or a hunk of engineering with which you're unfamiliar) ask the player to explain. Not only will you get the information you're lacking, you'll make the player feel good for being so creative.</p><p>Develop a good rapport with the command staff of the ship. Communicate often with the CO (but I don't advise pestering him/her ), and make sure that the ship is running smoothly. If activity isn't what it should be, then it's important for the CO and GM to figure out a way to get more people involved in the sim.</p><p>Make sure that your sim can involve every department on a ship. That's probably the most difficult aspect of developing a sim; something I've found rather annoying is that a sim will leave out a department entirely, leaving them to fend for themselves. Counselors, in particular, seem to get the shaft when a sim is being run; assignments will be divvied out, and then the counselor is stuck with crew evaluations or the like. Try to ensure that every department on the ship can be utilized.</p><p>Ask questions if you're stuck. If there's a particular piece of technobabble that someone brings up in a sim that confounds you, then ask for advice from someone else; the GM Monitor (if applicable), the CO, someone from the Engineering Department.</p><p>Never try to outline every movement that will take place within a sim. It is extremely important to allow the players to have some flexibility within the sim; people will undoubtedly come up with ideas that the GM would never think of, and it's important to keep that in mind as much as possible. By the same token, though, it's equally important to not let the players run away with the sim by grandstanding, et al. If one person tries to run away with the sim on his own by doing something that's next to impossible, then the GM needs to put the skids to that so that solving a sim can be a team effort.</p><p>Regardless of skill, a GM needs to have a good rapport with the crew. Whether it's as an evil mastermind, a benevolent leader, a weenie, he has to be on very good terms with them.</p><p>You should always give freedom of expression to the players on a ship. It tends to make things more pleasent for everyone, and it reminds you that you're not there for yourself but for the crew. Your main mission is to make sure that everyone on the ship has a chance to express themselves creatively and to contribute to the sim and interact with others.</p><p>If you know you're taking a long LOA, don't accept a GM position. If you're already a GM and you have to go away, either leave enough to keep the crew busy while you're gone, or find someone to GM in your place.</p><p>Creative roleplayers often have little side sims going in addition to their participation in the main sim. If you see a way to incorporate their story into yours, be sure to ask them before you take over.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gm-conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div></div><p>You're now armed with all the GM theory you're going to need to get started as a GM, or improve upon your GMing skills. That doesn't mean there isn't anymore to learn. Even after years as a GM for STF, I'm still learning new things. Like life, GMing always changes.</p><p>If you've paid attention to what was said in this course; if you thought about the advice the other GMs provided; you're building on a solid foundation. Enjoy the journey.</p><p>Now it's time for the exam. Don't worry, it's not that hard. Not if you paid attention.</p><p>I'd like to take this opportunity to give credit where credit is due. The following individuals assisted in one way or another over the lifespan of this course (idea to fruition). My apologies to anyone I accidentally neglected to mention: Chris Ashley, Steve Ashton, Mike Bourdaa, Stuart Coll, Jeremy Friedman, Larry Garfield, Brian Moss, Mackael Stockhausen, Owen Townes, and Moe Younis.</p><p>Now go on, go. Take that exam. The sooner you take it, the sooner you'll be GMing. Good luck!</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gm-exam"></a>Exam</h2></div></div></div><p>Submission Instructions</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Write out your answers to the questions below.</p></li><li><p>E-mail them to the course grader: <a href="mailto:goeagle15@gmail.com" target="_top">Sarah Hemenway</a></p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Be sure to include your full name at the top of the e-mail!</em></span></p></li><li><p>Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send the original question, just the answers.</p></li><li><p>Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send your answers as an attachment.
